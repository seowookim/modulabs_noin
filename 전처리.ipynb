       " 'scott dr. scott allison, professor of psychology, university of richmond well greg, robert robert doesn t appear to be in any hurry to retire  both in real life and in this movie. greg greg smith, founder of agile writers of richmond, va i found the whole thing retiring. let s recap scott we meet ben whitaker robert robert, a 70yearold widower who is restless and dissatisfied with his life as a retiree. while searching for something meaningful to do with his time, he stumbles across an advertisement for an senior internship program. he decides to apply as an intern at a company called about the fit, a fastgrowing business that sells fashionable clothing online. ben s interview goes well and he is hired as an intern. greg greg smith, founder of agile writers of richmond, va but his new boss is jules a highstrung workaholic young woman anne  who micromanages everyone. at first she shuns ben claiming that she doesn t need an assistant. ben employs his oldschool discipline of never leaving the building before the boss and picking up the boss s loose ends. one day, he notices her driver is a bit too drunk to drive and he takes his place as jules driver. and before you know it they re best buddies. scott if you ve been following our movie reviews over the years, you know that i haven t been much of a fan of robert  s recent body of work. with the intern, there is now some promising indication that his slump is over.  shines in his portrayal of a retired gentleman from a bygone era who takes on the role of a rookie intern in a quest to inject his geezerly life with some meaning. he not only finds what he is looking for, he also manages to endow several other people s lives with richness, wisdom, and direction. the hero s journey here takes on a unique and interesting form. ben starts out as a useless minion to jules, but over time he evolves into a trusted sidekick. by the end of the film, ben is arguably jules equal, and also her mentor. to the extent that ben and jules are equals, one could argue that they are buddy heroes who follow the classic pattern of being at odds with each other at first and then grow into bffl s. whether ben is her sidekick, mentor, or buddy is open to interpretation here. regardless, their relationship evolves and becomes transformative for them both. greg i thought this movie was too reminiscent of last year s the interns starring vince vaughn and owen wilson. similarly, we have two older salesmen who teach oldschool lessons to the internet savvy youngsters of google. the intern is a little more personal in that ben takes on a more mentorly role early in the film. in fact, he much reminds me of a butler similar to hobson in 1981 s arthur  or even mary poppins. he takes jules daughter to kindergarten and fixes her relationship with her stayathome husband. scott, we just reviewed the martian where astronaut watney graduates from hero to teacher. in that review we noted the ultimate destination for the hero is to become a mentor. and i think we see this pattern revisited here in the intern. ben has been a leader of a major company and has retired to a sedate life. now, with this new opportunity, he has a chance to pass on his wealth of knowledge not only to jules, but also to all the members of her staff. he has found his final destination. scott greg, this movie has a sweetness to it that i found extremely appealing. both of the lead characters need something, and what they need can only be found with help from the other. jules wants to be seen as independent and so she resists ben s help. she is smart enough to know that ben represents no threat to her authority and legitimacy as a leader. so she bends, and as befitting a good hero story, her receptivity to change is brought about by a deep hurt  the devastating reality of her husband cheating on her. as you point out, greg, ben himself has already accomplished in life many of the goals that jules is now seeking. and so he is developmentally ready to just assume a helping role, a mentoring function. as they say, when the student is ready, the teacher will appear. the first half of this movie is devoted to jules not being ready. all heroes are humbled in some way, and this ends up being the key to her openness to transformation. i enjoyed watching these two heroes do all the things that heroes do when they are in two different stages of life. thirty or forty years in the future, i can easily envision jules doing all the things that ben is doing in this movie. greg actually, scott, i found this movie somewhat patronizing. aside from jules, all the other characters in the story were caricatures and stereotypes of millennials. ben is seated with the other interns, all of whom are recent college graduates. young davis is being kicked out of his parent s basement. so ben takes him in and teaches him the importance of getting out of bed on time and dressing in a suit and tie. young jason is too interested in partying and ben shows him the way of moderation. and young administrative assistant becky is drawn to tears when she fears ben is getting more attention than she is. i ve got a degree in marketing from harvard wah wah wah and of course ben calms her down with a pat and a hanky  then pushes jules to delegate some of her authority to becky. these are all stereotypes that will appeal to the older crowd, who appear to be the target audience. there s no nuance here. jules is the female mark zuckerberg who needs a nudge to realize that if she s going to play with the big boys, she has to grow a pair. and it s ben s gentle nudging that gets her there. i found it all very patronizing verging on condescending. scott sorry you felt that way, greg. the intern represents a comeback of sorts for actor robert robert, who shines as an older man looking for a way to live a meaningful life. his heroic urge to mentor others is fulfilled when he is partnered with a rising business star, played with great zest and skill by anne . this movie accomplishes what all good hero stories should accomplish it teaches us that when we re young, we need good mentors. and that when we re old, we need to give back, to do good mentoring. there s nothing condescending about needing help and giving help it s just a reality of lifespan development. for giving us a sweet tale of two lives intertwined across generations, i award this movie 4 reels out of 5. the two hero s journeys of our lead characters are fun to watch, and they show how two people who need each other can help each other grow and evolve. ben is wise enough to know he needs to come out of retirement to meet his need to mentor, and jules becomes wise enough to recognize that she needs mentoring. the movie s ending is ambiguous  does ben no longer need to mentor? this dual hero story is moving, sometimes silly, but compelling overall. i give this pair 4 heroes out of 5. the supporting cast is adequate but not terribly memorable. another intern is a comic figure. one of jules employees is also comedic in a pathetic sort of way. there s no real villainy to speak of. this is a story of people growing and developing more than it is a story of overcoming any particular villain. overall, the supporting characters earn a decent rating of 3 out of 5. movie cast hero greg i found the intern to be an overly simplistic, melodramatic, under humored and pandering to the older generation. even the idea that a woman could run her own company was undermined by her having to be taught the values of bygone days by an older man. i felt it was a boring, and like it or not, condescending look at a fantasy of modern business. i can t muster more than 2 reels out of 5 for the intern. i ll grant you a nice hero s journey for both ben and jules. it s a pattern i don t think we ve seen a lot of  a mentor who needs his upandcoming apprentice. and an apprentice who needs the mentoring of a former hero to rise to her own potential. i give these oddcouple buddy heroes 3 out of 5 heroes. the supporting cast were all weak cardboard cutouts of young people stereotypes. i ve already outlined my thoughts on them. 2 out of 5 cast points. movie cast hero',\n",
       " '30yearold ceo, jules anne  who has grown up her company with more than 200 employees in a year and a half. time is too short for her to be perfect for both home and work. she gets a 70yearold intern, ben robert robert who have been living his life and trying to start unconventional life after retirement. bens first job as a senior intern coming through a senior intern program is juless secretary. she feels uncomfortable to him because he is older than her. however, she starts to open her mind to him, who is always polite and attentive to her. it cannot be found free time of her life in the company who is involved in the all managements of in the company and rides a bike in order to manage her physical fitness in the company. jules company is a big online shopping mall, and all the systems are very hightech, but ben is still analog. however, he fully adapts to work in the job due to his rich lifestyle and unique sociability. he has used to analog, but his mind is still hot. although he may seem trivial, it is in fact crucial in terms of todays concern over different from the average 70 years old people we imagine. however, as like the impression given by the title intern, in the beginning of this movie, an unusual intern gives the impression of enjoying an interesting intern, but it starts to escape from the topic more and more. even though it is not an ordinary intern, it is what happen when trying to break through the point that if the company looks reality, there are many restrictions. when it shows the company, it uses to be able to make a horizontal and autonomous image, rather than a vertical structure, but it uses to utilize images of ann anne active and robert anne warm. fortunately, the images of the actor are naturally melting into the film, they are helpful to make the movie brightening. even though it is unrealistic to express the company. these are the characters that are unhate, so they become more empathetic and more sympathetic to the changes and events involved. it becomes a great attraction to the movie. my discussion of the events is in fact addressing the larger matter of limitations of situations. it has succeeded naturally to make tenderness in the beginning, but repetitive situations make the audience bored and have forced the limitations of setting from the setting of a drastic change. it might be said that this movie is chiefly about interns on the company. but the problem with this movie, in my view, is that movies have become closer to mentor than intern. it turs out as a campaign to hire a mentor as old intern. the view of the movie, which focused on interns, is narrowed the focus on the two people. events of outside of the company are increasing rather than outside of the company, and even an event that is kind of offence, is added for a tension of the movie. at this point, the fresh characters have only difference from the company, and it is similar to the relationship between father and daughter. ultimately, what is at skate here is that the relationship just as mentor between the two, rather than satire of companys culture through comparison and contrast between the older generation who devote themselves to the company for the half their lives and the younger generation who start to delicate to the company. it may be that the life of an intern is portrayed as an ambiguous point, and may have succeeded in finding intern like an angel in fairy tales.',\n",

       " 'a retired 70yearold widower, ben played by robert robert, is bored with retired life. he applies to a be a senior intern at an online fashion retailer and gets the position. the founder of the company is jules  anne , a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic. ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role  she doesnt intend to give him work and it is just window dressing. however, ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom. good, and surprisingly so. i was expecting a farcical halfbaked comedy about how an old guy rejoins the work force and struggles with modern gadgets and work processes. there are a few examples of that but the movie is far more than a story about generational differences. its more a drama than a comedy, and is a good one too. theres themes of generational wisdom, not judging people by their age or anything superficial and making the most of peoples talents. its also a movie about starting over, and doing what you enjoy. moreover, its simply a nice story. solid work by robert robert in the lead role. he doesnt do bad performances, but that hasnt stopped him in the past from taking on roles and movies that are well below his standards. this is not one of those roles or movies. sensitively played, and ideal for the role. good work too by anne , who is very convincing as the gogetting entrepreneur.',\n",
       " 'bottom line robert d made this movie! really enjoyed it! anne  also played a great part also .',\n",
       " 'a film that differentiates the young and old generation. i would definitely say it is the directors best film. i have liked her other films, but this is a lot different from them. i mean it was well written screenplay with much better understood the contemporary world than just focusing on the relationships as usual. so the addition of digital world stuffs made all the difference and i completely enjoyed it. dont think it would be another the internship as i initially thought, but slightly it is and much better everyway. you are going to agree with me that the films posters or the trailers were not very impressive as what the actual film did to grab our full attention. the two hours films are always a concern to me, but when a film like this runs for that long, i can even sit for another half an hour. anyway, with this story and its runtime, the pace was incredible. when theres something interesting is going on, we forget to focus on the flaws and enjoy our time, which is what i exactly did in here. this is not a comedy where youre going to laugh openly loud, it is a comedy in the sense of the set of characters the film has. i mean, the story is about the digital business and most of them who are into the computers are considered as geeks. so theirs world is nothing, but just hooked to their works and forgetting the actual world around them. even for the someone in the next room, they tweet. for them to remind only theyve changed, not the physical world and thats where our main character who is old and wise influence the younger generation people. so the actors were undoubtedly the best thing apart from the direction and the story. the 73 years old robert robert still impressing with his extraordinary character display. i dont know whoever was in mind when it was written, but this role perfectly fits none other than him. and then theres anne  on the opposite side who equaled with robert with her part. from the narration point of view, it started with robert, but quickly around in the middle it took a circle to cover others as well. and then comes from the professional to the personal life topic when it was developed and brought a small family who were affected by the workaholic mother. so if you enter it expecting a comedy, probably you wont disappoint with what it delivers against your wish which is a heartwarming drama with some emotional moments. surely recommended, especially the youngsters whore addicted to the digital world! 810',\n",

       " 'this movie was great. there was a great use of camera angles and symbolism. the story was original with many plot twists making it all the more better. being a feminist, i enjoyed seeing a woman in power and addressing the issues of feminism throuout the movie. it really brought attention to an untraditional household and made the situation seem realistic and a good thing. however, there was one specific part in the movie that i couldnt stop thinking about. in one scene, matt, paige, jules, and ben are in the ostins kitchen when paige tells her parents that maddy doesnt want to be her friend anymore and matt calls maddy bipolar on account of the fact that every other day she is has an issue with paige. children often have mood swings as they are trying to figure out how to deal with their emotions. bipolar disorder is not something to joke about because lots of people struggle with this very serious mental health issue. i would highly suggest that the producers decide to edit out the few lines that have to do with calling maddy bipolar as many people could take offense to it. this is the only reason i did not give five stars. other than that one scene, the movie was great and i highly recommend it!',\n",
