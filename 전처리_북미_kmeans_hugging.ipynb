       "{'review_cluster_0': 'A lot of shaming the new generation of men and glorifying the boomers. This movie makes people emotional and reminds us of why senior people are still very important in our society. I could see the importance of occupation at life. have always been a fan of stories about building friendships between young and old people, particularly in their exchange of wisdom which involves respect, mutual admiration, and compassion. It really liked playing with old people stereotypes but not in a bad way just in a ham-fisted way. Apparently this place only employs people under 35 who also happen to be loveable characters with some simple problems that desirous character can solve. But it is nice to see a movie valuing the wisdom that often comes with age, even if they overdo it quite a bit. Great work and lessons learned for life as a senior. Here\\'s some feminism, take a kick in the nuts ageism, gender roles, boom!

Ultimately, what is at skate here is that the relationship just as mentor between the two, rather than satire of company\\'s culture through comparison and contrast between the older generation who devote themselves to the company for the half their lives and the younger generation who start to delicate to the company. Part of the reason the film fails in this regard, I think, is because it tries to deal with both aging and gender roles and doesn\\'t consider how a nice idea in one context (lonely old man reintegrates into society by helping those with less life experience) can be ill-conceived in another (perfect man repeatedly saves woman). The issue is not, perhaps, that men have been disadvantaged and can\\'t grow up, it\\'s that the benefits they receive by default mean they don\\'t have to grow up.

The younger guys mock a lack of teach savvy. It\\'s quite simply a \\'generation gap comedy\\' that makes all the points it needs to make without really breaking a sweat: senior citizens are a wealth of knowledge and can bring value to an organization or relationship, young people can learn from elders (it\\'s of to shave everyday and dress for success) _x0085_ and vice verse (computers are our friend), there still exists some animosity between stay at home moms and working moms, stay at home dads face challenges of their own, running a company is hard work both physically and mentally, communication often requires more than a text or email, and staying true to one\\'s self is not always easy.

Next generations are only to show you how your laptop opens and how to create an account to facebook. You know some \"back in school\" flicks where the old guy or girl returns to \"school\" and instantly becomes one with the \"kids\" and gives life lessons to the youngsters, how to treat a girl, how to be punctual, about honesty and fidelity.

A simple & heartwarming tale that people of any age can relate to. This movie has a lot more going for it than just generational and age difference jokes as seen on the trailer.

It reminds us that age is just a number and that we can find purpose and fulfillment in unexpected places. Not laugh out funny and does not really has a lot to say apart from older people have skills and values that are worth something. Now and then a movie comes along that instead of polarizing senior citizens against the younger Internet media obsessed generation elects to show how mutually beneficial the two ends of the age spectrum can be. It does embrace some other topics (in an effort to make it seem less of a copy) such as the \\'working mom\\', \\'stay home dad\\', \\'oldie-but-goodie\\' - but in such a trivial way. The movie has great messages of successful women in the workplace, seniors still have wisdom to impart to young adults, and that men and women can have plutonic friendships without love or sex. The idea that is given the most attention is that older, experienced individuals still have a lot to contribute in the workforce. The handkerchief is a symbol of lost values which Ben reintroduces with a younger generation, along with other (little) things. Instead of another shallow dramedy, we\\'re presented with properly complex adult issues, like aging, loneliness, marriage, and career, told with sincerity and a healthy amount of Hollywood heart. The whole exaggerated idea that young people know everything while older people know nothing was also an insult and just wrong. Sure younger people are more in touch and in tune with technology all that is new...but older people provided they are healthy can be just as aware. Shows how success brings about changes hard to comprehend and also how old life also need craving of new. It\\'s low tech, that a 70 year old would think sufficiently feasible. *** The generation gap is bridged in this 2015 film where Robert De Niro plays an active 70 year old widowed retiree who signs on to a company in their program for senior interns. The best part of this film is the old adage of experience through age. The focus is on an older guy and how he relates to younger people— and visa versa. It reminds me of people I know, both young and old, who are open to listening and learning from each other. All generations have something to offer. It gives a positive message about seniors as they have much experience and wisdom on many aspects of life. I will say at times I felt fatigue with the ageism angle as it became the butt of the joke one too many times. The film addresses two acute problems at once: the talent pool of retirees, whom no one wants to hire, despite their experience (or who are not taken seriously in the modern business), and the problem of balance between work and family for women entrepreneurs, who usually feel guilty for not being able to cope with everything. Not exactly the first person to come to mind for the part of the warm and funny gentleman who teaches these young people a thing or two about the value of old school. age is just a number Review: I really enjoyed this movie because on the surface it is a story about keeping busy after retiring but at the heart it is a story of friendship. Not enough to come out of retirement, for sure, but enough to be able to really relate. The marketing leads them to believe it will be a clash between a young professional and a retiree that rises in action, then finds a tidy resolution just in time for the 90 minute mark. It\\'s a very avian outlook, respecting elders and focusing less on conflict than continuation. Some people will pick up on these subtle inconsistencies, others will just see a sweet story about a nice old man and will get all they need despite an openhanded finish. What you end up with is two hours of an old man dreaming about opening doors for some nice young lady who will admire him and tell her young male peers to be more like him and bring us all back into the glory days of men and why can\\'t we all just be nice to each other without ever having anything get complicated anyway? Watch this with your aging parents if you want to have a bearable time with them. Ageist, but that means the plot has to go somewhere else. We as young people think that we know everything but that is completely wrong.OLD people have experience and which is much more than knowledge and degrees. This business-centred story brings together multiple generations without diminishing the value of any age group. meter\\'s internship narrative shows that individuals with a few more years under their belt may lack in the same energy levels as their younger counterparts, but make up for it with experience and wisdom. In the book of Proverbs it can be read, \\'The glory of young men (and women) is their strength, grey hair the splendor of the old.\\' The Intern epitomizes this verse in the Bible by showing the value of various generations. Showing that throughout this life, there is a tendency to look upon certain ages as having greater value than others. What does the Bible say about getting older? Can each generation provide something in this life? We found it enjoyable all the way through and it has a good message about the younger generation not being so quick to discard the experience of the older generation. Writer-director Nancy Meyers was very close to developing an insightful film about the wisdom that comes from a senior citizen and the potentially useful role that retired people may play in advising the younger generation. Acting experience never grows old. While the message that older workers is valuable for an aging baby boom operation, the more important message he is that technology is a thing that can be used to bridge generations rather than separate them. The messages here are comedy and the search for a happy life, and the fact that money and age are not really the answers to the happiness problems. Additionally, the colors are very vibrant which add to the modern concept. And since generation is a recurring theme in Nancy Meyers \"The Intern\", I couldn\\'t help but think that he belonged to a generation that provided some of the best characters of cinema\\'s history, many of them incarnated the tormented and rebellious youth of the 70\\'s, and it sure tells you how time flies, watching Johnny Boy or Travis Bickle embodying a figure, whose respectability relies a lot on the age. This is very revealing of the twisted aspect of feminism and the preconceived ideas we have on our elder. I was born the same year than Hathaway and while I don\\'t consider myself a \\'millennial\\', I reckon that the Internet, Facebook, simplified the relationship and never taught us to learn how to confront people directly, court a woman or break up without using a phone. There\\'s not just a generation gap but also a gender gap that the film subtly points out, and the idea is that guys have lost the ability to earn what they achieved. The central theme is really about the younger generation versus the older generation and the different ideology of both generations. How an old person approaches something and how a younger person does. It is an engaging look at contemporary life and the human element that we often take for granted. This movie resembles coming of age comedy-dramas like Uptown Girls (2003) or Waitress (2007) but for the elderly with somewhat older established women. Although you do have to constantly reassure senior staff that women are allowed to wear pants to work. Internal Prominently promoted with the tailing \"Experience never gets old\", this Nancy Meyers movie spins a familiar tale of an old man proving his worth (despite being technologically backwards) and impressing the younger folks around him. Imagine a bunch of aging baby boomers who keep asking themselves, \"What happened to the world I used to know?\" ism fifty-eight, retired and trying to write my own memoirs but it feels as if someone\\'s beat me to the punch. It was also chockfull of morality and morals that anyone from any generation would do well to emulate. ism fifty-eight: college educated, former military, retired business owner, and I still tuck my shirts and polish my leather shoes. It juxtaposes the old, flip phone generation with the new iPhone generation in such a charming way that I can only say ... go see it. The main message here is that just because a person is old, they can still have purpose-there is an old saying about with age comes wisdom, and that point is proved here. It gives us a strong message to respect older people\\'s wisdom and experience, and that it can be very helpful even in the today\\'s teach world. One of those who can be an opinion changer about older people\\'s part in modern societies. whittler is a 70 year old man who isn\\'t terribly familiar with modern gadgets and in how the modern world works in general (which sadly houses an element of truth the older you become). It also shows a positive attitude towards the seniors in our society who usually plays oddball supporting roles. Older wiser gent. I understand that in today\\'s job market some young people are no good at most jobs, because they lack experience, education, ethics and what not, while older people lack ... an ability to cooperate with managerial idiocy. It\\'s funny and there are plenty of clever lines, but it\\'s also a character study on a number of levels: what it\\'s like to be retired and still feel the need to be needed; it\\'s also a look at relationships when traditional gender roles are reversed in pursuing careers and raising families. I was mid-60\\'s in a large office where the next eldest was under 40, and most under 30, and I wasn\\'t the boss. As Ben Whittacker realises, although he isn\\'t completely computer illiterate, he is surrounded by a generation of people who seemed to have had computer programs inserted at birth; he even has to ask his year old grandson what a us Connector is. desire is a widower, living a lonely and routine elderly life. It showed how anyone, no matter what their age or status, can have an important impact on our lives. Still_x0085_ They say that actors, lawyers and doctors never retire. The older they become the better they perform. Fully recommended for all ages. I really did love the old school versus new age philosophy on display and wish they had featured way more of that in the overall story. I cHathawayot imagine that the older generation will willingly volunteer for menial tasks for no reward especially when they can actually help people rather than just sell crap for somebody else, so I can only imagine that this is just an end run at persuading millennial that working for free is ultimately worth it, because, you know, corporations cHathawayot afford to employ you, or otherwise your parents are rich enough to support you while you \"buy\" an advantage over poorer people who cHathawayot afford to give up their labor for free! Thoroughly enjoyable movie about the value older members of society can bring to the workplace as well as the perennial issues of successful working women juggling work and family life. Do today\\'s audiences really want pre-feminist stories about wise old men that step in to prop up gorgeous and successful young career women whose feminine foibles are not only career-limiting but funny too? The old versus new culture clash is one long cliché expressed through baby-boomer work-ethic mini sermons offering fixes for the hipster\\'s free-for-all work-styles. This movie also speaks to generations. Whether right or wrong, the movie seems to be siding on the superiority of generations past. People of a \\'certain age\\' as the film divulges, are of little practical use. We are exposed to the minutia of humiliation as people repeatedly ask if they can hear them or remember what they\\'ve just said, because of course they\\'re old. As the film goes on, perhaps the ways of old were not complete nonsense after all. As a newly retired person I was definitely able to relate but the story of the young folks starting out in their careers is something other age groups in the audience can relate to. The title of this movie says \\'Experiences never get old\\'. I like the concept and it is definitely something that should be done more to keep older people feeling connected to society and not alone. And older widower finds meaning and potential love in retirement and singleness. Subjectively, I simply adored the basic premise of a widower filling the void in his life and showing the new generation of the old one how to do things. Generation v generation jokes and dilemmas, stereotyping all old people as useless etc. Now that\\'s something an old man always faces which is very beautifully shown here. The older and newer generation sitting and talking and sharing ideas. Awesome premise about a man fighting ageism in a modern and young corporation. We both laughed a lot, understood the predicament of the senior and how he captured the admiration of the youth. An \"Intern\" in Life and Love Throughout history, I imagine many members of the human race have been gerontophobic (i.e. afraid of old people or of getting old). In them, usually, elderly or older people are anachronistic, out-of-it, narrow-minded conservative fuddy-duddies that need exposure to today\\'s young whippersnappers to discover fulfillment and purpose. telephone book manufacturing company who is getting a teensy bit weary of retirement. He is not obsolete This movie was a great story about challenges that a baby boomer may face in the work environment at a newly obtained position. Creating some romantic tension between the two people from different generations. I would have preferred the sexual tension and romantic feelings between the 70 year old and the 20 something year old, over the more edgy comedic option. The movie would have also referred to the 1967 movie \\'The Graduate\\' with the difference that now a young woman would be falling for an older man instead of a young man for an older woman. The story starts out well - 70 or old needing something to do with his life other than travel and play golf. Here is an older man telling a younger generation of people how to live life and succeed and without his \"wisdom\" the whole company would fold. Calling all seniors, think you\\'re done with work, think again! The society we live devalues the elderly, but this movie attempts to reinstate our respect and realize their value. While being a fun movie it reminds you the value of elders, serving as a win-win for Nancy Meyers. The story\\'s hero is someone who comes out of retirement and starts working at an entry-level job. Since he is older, he doesn\\'t know much about young people things and they don\\'t know much about older people things either. It tries to bring up topics such as generational gaps, woman\\'s equality, the life of a widower, et but just glosses over them. Instead it shows that the older guy can impart his knowledge of business to this modern crowd, and at the same time find a sense of purpose, belonging, friendship and a new love along the way. Old guy who had a lifetime of happiness with his now deceased wife gets a girlfriend because being alone is bad. The differences between the older and younger generations was subtle yet impactful. The generation gap in the corporate world puts emphasis on the fact that office-goers from the 80\\'s feel out of place in the current techno-savvy biz world, interlinked with emails and social networks. Having grown up with a mum working with the elderly day in day out, she emphasizes the importance (sometimes to much in my opinion :) ) of not neglecting them and the experience and influence they still can bring to the table. Explore life even after the time you are retired instead of waiting life to be withered. I wish ism that cool when ism that old. And yes, truly new age! For a working population, retirement presents an opportunity to rest, freedom for work shackles and pressure coupled with the delicious thought of having to travel to places seen. More so, the film\\'s plot buttresses and enforces that idea: retirement isn\\'t what it seems to be. How do the over is age group cope with the just century teach suaveness: Google, face book, twitter and a host of others. It makes me notice that you can be friends with anybody without regard to age or sex. The story reflects the reality of our age, and the roles we\\'re assigned by society. It deals really well with the image of women as powerful figures, and with age-related perceptions. This story is suits modern world. Japan is aging society, so many people may sympathize with this story and this story may reflect modern social problem. I can receive the message that it is not too late to begin something even if you are 70 years old. The character of one 70 year old man and a young lady who is a president of Internet shopping company is really good. The elderly man plays an important rule to the lady overcome difficulties. The movie is the same old concept of old people catching up with new generation including the idea of stay at home husband to opening an account in Facebook. You have to always keep that hunger for learning alive in you no matter whatever stage you have reached in your life. This film reminds you of your grandparents, it reminds you older and younger generations can learn from each other. As you get older, your sense of exercise becomes dull, and the relationship between people is diminished. Young people can not understand at all, and the situation that only older people feel is coming at a certain moment. Looking back, life really went as fast as an arrow. Most of the past experiences are no longer needed because of advanced technology, but there may be times when you need a lot of experience and mindfulness at difficult moments. If you have an elderly senior when a difficult situation is happening, will not it be a bad thing? There were a couple moments where I had a tear in my eye as I could relate to both as an older adult. What I DIDN\\'T like about is was, a smart, together business woman -- forming and leading her own successful corporation in New York City -- still relies on the intelligence and wisdom of the elder male. Its so simply and elegantly portrays the life of old people and need of change for them, providing opportunities to them, crediting them for their experience. It is true, instrument players - professional players - do not retire. They live on their life\\'s by making music everyday. They may give lessons for further generations but they never quit, they never drop their instrument once they retire. The average age of the audience when I attended was about 60. The perspective of a busy woman, an experienced old man and a man with a lack of emotion helps you to understand people better. If you went to watch the film to see it make some kind of statement on life and motivation, if one is ever too old to work, and whether there is a limit to learning, you will find none of this here. Warm and emotional movie,,, ,The elderly who had spent without age entering finds the last day digits and applies for internship and becomes unemployed ... Sadly, most of the movie\\'s patrons were middle-aged or seniors. The concept of senior citizens opting to come out of retirement and reboot their careers is a fresh one, which is what the movie centers on. Inter action of people of two different generations has been so nicely depicted. Impressive ways to highlight the good of two different generations. An old-school retired executive meets a new-age Tech CEO and both the world\\'s come together gracefully, learning from eachother, appreciating and complimenting eachother. Nice story about the intermingling of two generations and the accompanying contrasts and conflicts. I just love how desire uses many now obsolete norms of the past in a modern hipster style teach setting. De Niro represents the old school of men already dying and giving place to the new hipster metro-sexual boys. It shows you the balance of life in such a different way and view and that you can do anything no matter your age or gender. In 2021, last May my dad passed away, in tune have been demolished by office due to slow income and cut some senior staff. We found it pretty realistic about the fast pace of today\\'s businesses and the conceived value of a younger workforce that understands technology and a fast and exorbitant work pace, with the older generation\\'s experience being taken for granted. And enjoyed a nice exploration of the two generations\\' approach to work style and how the old and new can work together and build off of each other. It also reminds that what our old people knows about the work and life is really far away from what we think they know. Also for younger audience it as good example what life looked like when we are weren\\'t chasing careers and wealth. Has a modern touch to it. Old is gold, the movie proves this statement. And at last, the experience never gets old. Not only that but in my opinion it also shows the older generation that their skills and experience can be put to good use even after retirement, e.g. It followed a well written story line along with doing a fantastic job of informing views about what life can be like depending on your gender, age, career, to name but a few. The entire family can watch this one and enjoy the value that older people can bring to the workplace, even to an Internet start-up. Several themes interplay off each other; older people in a new teach workplace, working mothers trying to balance family, marriage and a career, and stay-at-home fathers; as well as perceptions of older people. This reminded me that every generation does have something good we need to remember. No matter, they have a huge age gap, they become good friends. Experience never gets old\\'. I guess, it means that experience\\'s always needed, it\\'s always modern and it\\'s always useful, no matter, what sort of experience it is. This generation need to hear all of these . It identifies at least two problems of social inequality in the modern world - inequality of young and old people in employment and gender inequality. The movie tells the story of a pensioner who, after the death of his wife, does not want to live to retire, but wants to work. On the one hand, it means that anyone can always start life from scratch, regardless of age. Nobody expects from old guy any awareness about clothes industry, nobody wants to spend their time with boring retirees. So, main character refuted all the claims against old people\\'s inability. Certainly the movie not one person has improved the mood and proved that life doesn\\'t end with reaching retirement age! It is very surprising, but ambitious woman and experienced elder become best friends. I think the moral of the story, that life can be lived at any age, is good. Is it a classic that will be remembered and studied for years? It is more a tale of classicism vs. contemporary and it works! Don\\'t hesitate to let it age on you! I could have given it 8 stars maybe, for it\\'s commentary on urban, comfort-class social quandaries around gender and age. Can we grow up now? I specially suggest all millennial watch this! And your ages is not always the biggest problem. between baby boomers and millennials. The relationship between old and new is brought together to create a movie that makes you smile. The best part was about the handkerchief, where the old guy suggest to the young one to have a handkerchief so when the time is right you could lend a handkerchief to women/girl.',\n",
       " 'review_cluster_1': 'A true feel good movie that I wish I saw in theaters. Very entertaining movie for when you just want to have a good time. This movie was a good one to just throw on and enjoy, it\\'s usually not my type of movie but I quite enjoyed the duo onscreen and the lessons you learn along the way. If you\\'re looking for a feelgood film, this is it. I came across this movie because I was looking for a wholesome movie that would make me regain some sort of faith in humanity. I always go hopeful, happy, and content after watching this movie. If you want to simply smile for 2 hours straight, go ahead and watch this movie. it\\'d been having a terrible week where everything has gone wrong, and this movie was on to in my hotel room and helped to distract me for a bit. I found myself smiling at some parts, and it was overall just a nice movie It\\'s a movie that makes you smile and caught a little. What a movie it was, i don\\'t know why this movie has low rating but believe me this is masterpiece, mood changer🥰 this film gives a good vibe with the chemistry of its protagonists Will be one of the all time classics, as good as \"its a wonderful life\" and others. This movie was so wholesome and amazing 👏 there were times I almost cried 😢 and lot times it made me smile But when I watched it, I found the movie to be a fresh watch, something so subtle but touching with glimpses of laughs. So, it\\'s not original, so it raises a few issues that we may not agree on or whatever but this movie made me laugh, then cry, and in the end, it left me with a feeling of warmth. Anyhow still a well-executed, emotionally mature, well-written movie to watch. Not so feel good movie. This movie is just such a feelgood movie, I always end up so happy after watching it. This movie is really healing me! One of Nancy Meyers\\' absolute humane best with the usual charm-turned sweetness into something unexpectedly wholesomely heartening, benefitting from the finely casted chemistry\\'s that were enough to make this hilarious, insightful comedy one of the best feel-good films in recent memory. The movie is about love, life, lessons, falls, and getups. This movie is very sweet and does a fantastic job of building the relationship between the 2 main characters It\\'s a feelgood film. The film looks good though, the cinematography is fantastic. The good connection between the protagonists makes the film absolutely appreciable, a light and fleeting experience. This is one of those movies that just puts you in a happy mood. I don\\'t necessarily dislike this film, but it has way too many cheesy/cringey moments for me to enjoy it. The film is not only heartwarming, but leaves you with a good feeling inside. It\\'s the ultimate feelgood movie, and it tackles issues in the most wholesome way possible. One of the best feel good movies of this generation and gives a nod to old school customs. this movie cements my love for De Nero, a feel-good movie that started brilliantly introducing that scary side of a seventy-year-old widower\\'s insufferable life, which changed a lot when he accidentally found a flyer about a senior internship program. I have seen this movie at least three times and always enjoy it every time. It was a feel good movie was some heart and some laughs but nothing special. It\\'s a nice, sweet, uncomplicated movie that will begin disappearing from your mind before you get out of the theater and will have left you completely by the time you get to the car. This is a heartwarming movie, despite a muddled plot, uneven performances, and some implausible situations. This movie had me hooked from the word go. Over all the movie was a great depiction of the unique friendship between generations. This movie made me CRYYYY so much! Not the sad kind of cry but it teared me up in knowing how good the movie was! The movie really touched me through the bones. The first time I cried so much for a movie because It was just soon damn good! Pretty much just ok. Had kind of touching dramatic moments as well as funny ones, and also digs a little deep at times that flow well with the movie dealing with topics like work-life balance, women in the workplace and infidelity. This movie had a lot of heart. I was in the mood for a laugh and that\\'s why I picked this movie. He alone makes this movie worth seeing. This movie is really charming, especially in the beginning. There\\'s nothing challenging or all that memorable but you\\'ll feel good after watching it. It was generally a good movie. The movie was intriguing and heart warming By far one of my new favorite movies. An average feel good movie. SCOTT: Greg, this movie has a sweetness to it that I found extremely appealing. This movie accomplishes what all good hero stories should accomplish it teaches us that when we re young, we need good mentors. For giving us a sweet tale of two lives intertwined across generations, I award this movie 4 Reels out of 5. It becomes a great attraction to the movie. That is why I enjoyed this heart felt movie. The most romantic platonic movie... It\\'s a sweet film with a lot of flaws, but it also has a realistic view on life for this woman and that touches many other people at different points in their life. It was a wholesome, simple yet intriguing movie. Nancy Meyers movies are always so upbeat and positive and everything always works out and the scenery and settings are vibrant. I can\\'t object to most of the many criticisms levelled at it, but the movie\\'s a genuinely pleasing and kindhearted experience if you\\'re willing to give yourself over to it. great movie for young ladies to see their potential If you watch this film, you will absolutely inspired it. This is a 2015 america love comedy film directed, written and produced by Nancy Meyers. If you watch this movie, you would absolutely be exhilarated. But I think I want this film to show more deeply love. One of those light films but with good performances that if it touches you at the right time it arrives and you like it very much. The movie seems to be a set up to glorify a good ole boy, but eventually morphs into a solid feelgood comedy/drama. nice film hepten, De Niro and smislen za used to :) sweet little film, but the ending was terrible. This is not great cinema, and will probably be forgotten long before Citizen Kane, or Casablanca, or Cries and Whispers, but it was fun to watch and we enjoyed it, start to finish. Happy, calm movie. enjoyable feel good film as an map gets a job as an intern in a young workforce If you\\'re in the mood for a sweet, poignant, uplifting story then this is your film! A nice movie that is easy to watch but will also be easy to forget Sat down and watched the flick with my three girls and really enjoyed it. Personally one of my favorite movies now every time i watch it I still love it, Great Film. It was quite a nice film to be honest. It\\'s also a movie about starting over, and doing what you enjoy. I would definitely say it is the director\\'s best film. A movie about an older man that is retired going back into the outdoor world and getting a job as a intern in a young people work place is a great plot. I would very much suggest this movie. It was a REALLY GOOD movie, a wholesome, not goofy/dirty/liberal trash heap. this is a film I liked it made me fell good and happy As long as you don\\'t really pay attention to the plot, it\\'s a nice movie. This movie is nothing about that, instead it\\'s adorable and probably one of my new favorite movies. So much so that I watched it again with my wife after getting back, to confirm that it wasn\\'t just the alcohol and canal that made me smile and cry basically through the entire movie, it actually is really charming. Didn\\'t know much about this movie before I watched it, but it turned out to be very good. A feelgood movie with endearing characters and a storyline that was convincing, engaging, and humorous enough to keep me hooked till the end. To me, the film captures what life feels like for younger adults in the job world--a little glamorous and exciting, but mostly hard and emotional. Overall, this movie doesn\\'t leave a hugely strong impression, but it does leave one pleasant enough that I will happily recommend watching it. It\\'s a great feel good movie. Thought it would be a so so cheesy movie but I loved the characters. The movie touched my heart a bit... Every millennial should watch this flick, if only to take notes on bends (Robert De Niro\\'s) old-fashioned charm, humble integrity, and stunning work ethic. The movie itself is not great content wise...But the point at which i ended up seeing the movie made my day..Its your typical feel good movie...and i quite liked it. It was a breath of fresh air to watch this movie...A typical feel good movie after which one gets a feeling that life is beautiful...and at the end of which one truly wishes that it was... This was kind of cute, sort of a revese \"Devil Wears Prada\", but it lacks the quirkiness of Prada to make this film truly endearing. Overall, it\\'s not a bad film, it has a good heart just not genuinely heart-warming. I enjoyed every minute of this lovely jewel of a film. I highly recommend this film for all the sentimental hearts out there! The movie falls apart a bit in the third act because of the introduction of an unnecessary plot line, but overall, it\\'s a strong movie that I tremendously enjoyed. I would describe it more as a feelgood movie. It was also incredibly sad at times and I even cried with the characters, but there was definitely more laughter and you walk away from the movie with some hope for the human race in general. If you just want to relax, but watch a movie with some substance this is definitely it. I thought this was an excellent movie showing the usefulness and wisdom of an older generation and its relationship with the younger generations! The sweetest movie have seen in a long time. 6/17/16 ho Cute film with predictable story line and dialogue. In today\\'s movie world with sex, violence, chi images and \"adult language\", this is a fun, harmless easy going movie that makes you feel good. Fun and sentimental non violent well acted movie This film really shows how keeping a positive attitude on life can really affect the lives of those around you and how one person can make a world of difference. This is a great family film, date night movie, whatever you want it to be it can be that, so I suggest you watch it and enjoy. I don\\'t even know how this movie has a single good review. The movie is sweet, charming , and is over all well done .. Great cast & a good story - heart warming This movie pleasantly surprised me. I was expecting a very clichéd romantic comedy that it\\'ll forget as soon as the credits roll. This is a nice, fluffy movie that I recommend people check out This is a movie that is missing something but makes up for it with a lot of charm. Probably one of the best movies have seen in a long time. Really good movie, it\\'s not every day you find a good movie to see and enjoy. TRULY ENJOYABLE-NOT MANY MOVIES ARE THIS PLEASURABLE TO WATCH. First movie that has held my attention in a while! Congrats you just joined \"As good as it gets\" and \"Something gotta give\" in my feel good movie marathon. I guess for me this movie especially struck a chord because I am a coo under 40 with a child. It is about as charming of a film as I have seen in years. Good feel good movie. You can\\'t go wrong with Robert De\\'nerio and the movie is funny and has a great concept but there is something missing. However, this movie was pretty charming. This film truly is about friendship, family, and life in general. Everything about this film moves at a very solid pace and you feel like it is giving you a slice of life at this moment in their lives. At its heart that\\'s what this movie is, a feel good production that will boost your mood for the next day or week. Feel good movie but I must say the performances are better than the film itself some parts of the film felt forced, but overall it\\'s good surface of life movie The two leads are fantastic together and in spite of lost opportunities to turn this into something deeper, it remains an enjoyable, feel good movie. I watched this movie last night with my girlfriend (who is a film major), and she loved this one. A good movie for 40 years old ladies A great feel good movie that is becoming seemingly more rare as the years go on. This movie tugged on my heart, and brought a smile to my face. An enjoyable easy going film A good movie option for a date night if you can absorb the unusual chemistry between its leads who are in top form. Words can not express my love for this movie. Just a clean light non hostel movie, i found it boring to be honest, glad i didn\\'t spend the money in the theater but DVD. Good feel good movie I half expected a cheesy movie, very watchable. a light positive joyful movie about how it\\'s never too late. Fun movie, little painful in parts but overall a good balance for a his and hers This movie is an enjoyable romantic comedy. Most enjoyable feel good movie. When I was a boy De Niro made movies like Goodfellas, Casino, Heat. A nice feelgood flick to chill out with on an uneventful weekend. at 60% i thought this movie would be a good watch with my wife, something i could tolerate that she\\'d enjoy. I don\\'t think it is as good as Nancy Meyers It\\'s Complicated, but it\\'s a movie that I found to be difficult to hate. it had been a long time since I have seen a great movie but tonight marry and I were not disappointed with this film. it is a \"feel good\" sort of film. I feel guilty for liking this movie, but I did. Excellent flick to watch after a day of hard work but no real substance. A great film which is well thought out that was \"rotten tomato\" this one was the Hathawaya I had grown to love through the dinner movies. Review: I must be getting soppy in my old age, because I actually enjoyed this movie. I know that it\\'s extremely corny and the storyline is predictable but I found the movie sweet and desire was great as the perfect gentleman. don\\'t ride this movie off.. Its a \"feel-good\" movie with great performances from the staring roles which leaves you feeling happy and delighted with your movie choice. Great for people looking for a movie that will entertain the whole family and will leave everyone smiling by the end. Heart melting fantastic film Best movie have seen in theaters in a long, long time!!! the idea of the film that experience never get old is is cause am glade to defend about it any time so its great for me. A really strong film that I recommend. It\\'s a true \"feel good\" movie. An earnest and gentle film that\\'s very pleasant to watch. It\\'s the type of film that makes you feel so warm inside, that you just want to go out and cheer up anyone who is feeling down. A truly enjoyable film to be sure, so grab the popcorn and relax because this film is in the hands of two veterans. A sweetly entertaining film with a better than average late period performance from De Niro. Charming movie for adults who enjoy good acting, great cast, and excellent script. A simple light hearted movie, good to watch. Another film you get like you\\'ve seen before but really enjoyed it throughout the film. The plot fairly guessable but it was definitely a feel good movie and nothing was really aggravating like when they make it wicked depressing. I wanted the movie to keep hoing. In this movie it set a real good feel and tone. Nancy Meyers wrote and Directed the movie and I have to give her \"Props\" it had same feeling as Sleepless in settle and other nor from movies. Another significant positive is that the film makes you feel very good throughout, really helping the viewer buy into this relationship. The film does not do anything remarkable, it is just a fun and cute simple and cloche movie that is just \"alright.\" Excellent movie which sends you on an emotional roller coaster. A good old fashioned feel good movie. A normal movie, but nice and nice to see. I saw this more than once in theaters, and it\\'s just one of those films you can watch over and over. A popular comedy with heart brain and some amazing human moments, this film is a little spark of hope and delight in times of highly dramatic Superheroes narratives usually lacking depth on the human level. I really believe this is a great film about our times, the changes, the struggles to adapt but also the importance of having friends, moral support and above all, people that respect you and love you unconditionally, because all that you will never get it from an app... Love desire in any movie! Fun movie, it has a real feel to it cause it portrays modern values very well, and talks about new york life style and who doesn\\'t love that? Great Valentines Day flick with my husband. A lovely, charming and wholesome film. A definite feel good movie that will leave you smiling. Beautiful movie that has covered so many aspects of our everyday life! Brilliant movie, that puts you in such an ease and makes you want to watch more and more of it. This movie turned out to be, dare I say, a \"cute\" palette cleanser. This movie has such a warm heart, so it was almost impossible for me not to like it. This movie was extremely motivational and told a story of an amazing tale of a woman who could balance a family and her very own business. Great tween & teen movie. I enjoyed it very much not something I usually sit and watch ism more in violence and horror but the story line was sweet to the heart Despite I thought the movie was a comedy movie at first, it is a really warm and fragrant one that tears wear up in my eyes at the end of the movie. Really feel good movie. It\\'s a cute and sort of quirky movie that you just don\\'t see anymore. A very moving film with a nice pace and rhythm to it, connecting on a lot of different levels from a retired boomer needing to find meaning in his life to a hard-charging businesswoman who also needs more meaning of a different kind in her life. 7.5/10 Very sweet (too much I think), feel-good movie. A very heart-warming, pleasant movie. This movie was my favorite romantic comedy of the year. A lovely film about the value of relationships, including inter-generational ones. A cute movie to watch when you need to feel good about the doggone world. What a nice movie that gets you in the feels. This movie was thoroughly pure entertainment and I loved everything about it. easily the best movie of 2015. It had a decent story and some good acting and was just an enjoyable film. I suffer from the disease of watching my favorites movies again and again and again. It\\'s a movie that moves you to work harder on your passion, peace and your people. I haven\\'t seen a really good movie in a long time and definitely recommend it to anyone! A cute and feel good movie - no violence or drugs. An okay movie that was calm and funny with a touch of emotion. I was looking for a simply entertaining movie and found it. A fun and sweet movie which contrasts what once was with what now is. The context of this movie is not only very timely, but it\\'s also an overall, feel good movie! I had high hopes for this movie but it kinda let me down. As sweet and classic as desire is this film truly is a calling card for how awful the new generations are. Feel good fun movie. Expected move of a comedy, but a nice movie non the less. This is one of those movies that make you feel good, remind you there is hope. Its still a very sweet movie though. good acting nice feel good movie but oh my gosh the feminist bullshit in this one! Surprisingly good, although the entire film is entirely predictable. wonderful movie, no words for de niro, nine beautiful. a feel good movie. awesome movies, unique idea, highly recommended to watch Overall it was a good, relaxing movie...but far from great. One of those feel good movies! A good flick to watch with your date. A very cute movie with some good advice about relationships and the art of how to be a man. Really liked this film funny at times and a very heart warming movie and the performances from the main actors and actress and amazing x A very interesting, joyable, positive movie. great family, comedy, feelgood film. \"You\\'re never wrong for doing the right thing..\" Loved the movie, great to see De Niro\\'s charm back on screen. A good movie with many heartwarming, feel good scenes. The movie was incredibly heart felt. The movie was heartfelt and plucked the right strings. That would have wrung my heart and made me fall head over heels in love with this movie, in a way unknown to me since Free Willy. a good little feel good movie to enjoy with a significant other. It was enjoyable to see the interactions between a baby boomer and the get Y. Nancy Meyers best film since What Women Want. A great story for a chick flick A cute little film that has really funny moments and then dragged out moments. It\\'s a \"good for your soul\" kind of movie! Cheesy, mellienial type movie. One of the best films have seen all year Pleasant but slow moving movie with likable characters. Like sleepless in settle and when Harry met Sally, this movie has a familiar, feel good sense about it. With a great supporting cast and a really good script, I would very much recommend this movie. Relaxing and fluent movie for sundae evenings, A phenomenal film that surprised me, made me laugh, and kept me hooked to the very end. I like movies like this good fur the family!!! Nice wine an pizza movie Few movies will enthrall you like stroking in a feather, lets you feel a gentle breeze and to go back to bed with a quiet mind like a pristine lake. It\\'s a lighthearted film. So if the premise intrigues you, and the trailer seems like something you might enjoy, then I can guarantee you will enjoy it. Just a wonderful, extremely feelgood movie. I think all of this makes it a decent flick. Thankfully this was appropriate for her age, and it was a feel good movie. A lighthearted movie that\\'s a lot of fun. A \"nice\" film. A movie filled with smiles and laughs. Cute and heartwarming on a number of levels, this film was nearly perfect (a few of the masseuse scenes were unnecessary and some of the plot twists were cliche). ism not sure what I like most about this movie. Having been my MIL caregiver this movie reminded me of her and my mammal because they both had more active social lives in their late is than I did in my late 30s! It feels more like a chick flick than I would\\'ve guessed and can be cheesy at times. One of the cutest, simplest, and most enjoyable movies have ever seen! It was a heartfelt movie, and had some funny points about growing older and how someone retired can still add good value to the younger generations. I wish my current office was as fun as the one in the movie! Such a feel good movie. Good movie to make you fall asleep. this is a example of a true relaxing experience, with a great cast and perfectly sculpted screen write it a great film if you want to just enjoy a good movie. A really feel good movie Best have seen in a long while Could be a great made-for-TV movie if one were to stumble upon it while sick in bed. An enjoyable film that is filled with comedy and a good plot. Funny, touching and feel good movie. Mediocre story, funny, great performances, just a pleasant little movie that i enjoyed with some of my favorite actors. Sincere family movie fun movie entertaining wife liked it fun to watch to outstanding actors with a huge age gap create such great chemistry worth the price of admission The film paces beautifully, kudos to the editing team. This movie tugs at your Heart strings. Overall this movie was just okay. What can I say but what a fantastically nice movie. The small and simple things in this movie make you smile on so many occasions that the characters jump out at you and you can\\'t help but feel for them. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a nice calm and enjoyable movie with two fantastic actors who slip into characters as if they were already them. Being a feminist, I enjoyed seeing a woman in power and addressing the issues of feminism throwout the movie. Feel good movie, a little cheesy for my taste. Movie is a great, inspiring and motivational for all ages! I really enjoyed it and you really cared about every person in the movie. The movie provides laughs and also tears to the viewer. A great date film, or just feel good fix for anyone. This movie made me feel so good. This was a refreshing uplifting movie. have seen it ex considering seeing it a and time, as it leaves you happy and having faith in the world as a person that is somewhere in the middle of older and younger, it\\'s a GREAT MOVIE! Just a \"nice\" film; I don\\'t mean that insultingly... it was just relentlessly... nice. RATING: 4/5 RT, 8/10 IMDB. Good movie that puts life into perspective for the young entrepreneur. The film is a feelgood movie that showcases some great life lessons and thoughts. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and suggest that everyone give this movie a chance and enjoy it for it\\'s humor and sentiment. It\\'s a cute, harmless, little movie, with great leading performances that elevate the otherwise generic material. Real chick flick but Bobby desire is terrific wonderful feel good flick without clichéd plotting Probably the best feel good movies of the year. This was a cute movie that appeals to the young and the old! Good date night movie, not to chick-flick, not a love story, just a human story. The locker character was so painful to watch I stopped halfway through the second one as an ho movie on to and never watched it again. so loved this movie, awesome acting, perfect chemistry, funny, heart warming Great feel good movie? The movie overall has a good tone to it and makes you laugh every so often. Definitely a \"date\" movie, or a movie to watch with your mom... Hathawaye and desire are solid as always job and have a nice charm, but overall movie lacks substance. it was a good soulful movie to make you think of the person that came to your life and be your best friend would love to see more movies like this! It was truly a pleasure to see a movie that made me both laugh and cry, something I have not experienced in quite some time from a single movie. I wholeheartedly encourage that you see this movie because it is just delightful! \"Heartfelt and funny, a film I could never get bored of. It was a pleasant New York City based film. Please go see this movie, it will turn your day around if you\\'re in a slump.\" It was a good movie, but I wasn\\'t a big fan. Very interesting, a lovable movie that will go to the heart and a little comedy that you will laugh your butts off at. Nancy Meyers has made a couple of films I have enjoyed, the now fairly forgotten What Women Want, where she got a good performance from Mel Gibson and paired him with an inform been Hunt, and then her following film, Something\\'s Gotta Give, where she generated great energy from Jack Nicholson, but also went one better by pairing him with a fantastic Diane Keaton. This is where the movie got my hopes up. It\\'s a sweet enough movie to watch, and I enjoyed parts of it, but it fell short of my expectations. it was great I think it was a very happy and heart felt movie I saw it with my middle-aged father and he also loved it. A breath of fresh air in the chick flick genre! (nice) chick flick. Feel Good kinda movie Lovely feel good film well acted. Good movie but not much story there - good acting, nice idea but it needed more substance to get 4 or 5 stars...usually love Nancy Meyers films but this one is a little short on interesting story. A feel good movie that pushes all the right buttons, without being cloying or derivative. Good family Movie and couples type. I felt like I smiled throughout the entire movie. A nice film but not an amazing one. I recommend it if you want to watch a feelgood comedy movie that touches on perseverance and independence. If you\\'re looking for a chilled out movie that you don\\'t need to pay attention too then this is the movie for you... p.s I\\'ve only watched the trailer. Set my expectations real low and allowed myself to fully enjoy the film for the nice, light treat that it is. Left really happy that I chose to see this movie. Refreshing, heartwarming movie! It was definitely one where I came out of the movie feeling better than when I went in. Was a genuine sweet movie. Not a bad movie at all. Feel good movie - Much needed Best movie I have seen this year It\\'s an of movie, not great but not horrible. SO GLAD I went to see it in theaters than just waiting for it to come out on videos!!! This movie shows her just as that, but it was a very family-friendly/oriented movie. I loved this happy feel good movie!! A movie that you leave feeling like you want to be a better friend. Its a heart warming film! I enjoyed this emotional roller coaster with punches I saw coming, but it was nice and the actors seemed to be having a good time. They quickly captured my interest, and held it throughout the movie. Entertaining, touching, fun movie. Ah one of those feel good films I suppose. But besides this it was a great movie. A cute and heart warming film with a star studded cast. Although it is unoriginal and a little predictable, the humor and likeability of its two stars makes this a very watchable movie. This is a really good date movie, and quite endearing. Fun natured, interesting, good time movie. This movie also has one of the best scenes of the year. Such a heart tugging film, it\\'s completely not what I expected it to be and I can\\'t recommend it enough! My husband and I went on date night and it was a good movie I laughed and I got a bit emotional. Quintessential Nancy Meyers film, a bit schmaltzy but oh so likeable. A topical film for modern times, sweet and a little messy at the same time. Really good feel good movie ! The most emotionally compelling film have watched in a long time. Best movie have seen in a very long time. Just an overall good feeling movie. I don\\'t usually like chick flicks but I loved this one. We were pleasantly surprised with how funny and heartwarming this movie is. It was a good film for date night. This movie was a guilty pleasure for me, I enjoyed it a lot can\\'t deny it! A perfectly cute, harmless movie. Don\\'t need to see it in theaters, but worth your time to see sometime. A nice feel good movie where you don\\'t have to think that hard... just lose yourself in the idea of human relativity. Lovely enjoyable feel good film. I gave it 5 stars because never once did the thought \"okay, when will it end\" come to mind as it usually does if the film drags... Also it had a nice story to it, if there were clinches I did not notice, because the film had my full attention. What I didn\\'t realize is that I didn\\'t expect this movie to be really great, just thought it was just there. This movie is so charming and heartwarming, Robert De Niro delivers his best work since Silver Lining Play Book and Hathawaye Hathaway also does very well and alongside a decent cast and a very simple but good plot they are all delivering the goods in a very good movie, It\\'s really recomended, especially if you want to feel good...:) A cute film that is well acted my the 2 stars but is a little long, but is worth seeing on a first date. Thoroughly enjoyable fish out of water movie. It was nice to feel respected by a movie. A pleasant movie to watch. One of the best feel good movies of 2015. If you are looking for the next feel good movie. A cute movie for a relaxing afternoon at the movies. This was an overall feelgood film worth the light and easy journey. It was an enjoyable movie cute funny all around good comedy movie to go see for sure Go if you get a chance, it\\'s a feel good movie. Nice break from action movies! However, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it- it had the whole theater laughing, crying, and laughing some more. I never knew where it was going and all together it was a fantastic feel good film. Only complaint was, the movie ended leaving me wanting more. Sweet and endearing movie about getting on life and complicated relationships in a modern world This film has so much heart. The rescueable is perhaps the first third of the film, where a well-defined beginning is seen where a beautiful friendship story is built that diverts from its path to be saved only by the performances of Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. This movie made me happy Saw the Movie Twice and it was Better each time! Feel good movie that delivers exactly what would you expect from the circumstances. If you liked her previous movies, which I did, you\\'ll like this. This movie made me cry and the ending was just atrocious. Great feelgood movie The film moves in a smooth pace, filled with nice music and inspiring scores, along with a gentle spirit that attracts audiences to spend time following the amusing characters for about 120 minutes but a little bit upset by the rushing second half and too unrealistic perfection on its ending. Not the greatest movie but still enjoyable. I definitely recommend this movie when you need a mood lifter anchor encouragement. While a perfectly alright watch, this film is nothing special. Sometimes you just have to pay the bills movies are some of my favorites. A nice feel good movie. This is a charming movie with some tender moments and some witty humor at times. A nice feel good film. I love how this movie made the classy old school way of doing things cool again. Offering plenty of laughs and smiles, the film tosses in several heavy doses of reality and sadness-all mixed into an otherwise straightforward storyline. Grade: A Read my entire movie review at www.reelbrief.com Feel good movie you can\\'t help but smile. No surprise plot twists or suspense, but an enjoyable movie about an older man able to befriend and mentor the young people in the company. Thought it was a feel good movie....... a nice respite from all the violence around us all. I know the reviews were mixed on this one, but this was the movie we all agreed on and ism glad we did.

My friend and I went to watch it just a few hours ago and we enjoyed the movie, it was funny, sad and more. A lighthearted movie filled with smiles and laughs. I wasn\\'t even going to see this film but then I got invited and decided to go. I thought this movie had the right balance of funny and sad moments. It was just a very cute and feel good movie. A good date movie. One of the best movies I like from her is dinner\\'s The Parent Trap. If you want some pleasant movie and just some laugh this movie is it. A chilled out movie and a good laugh. Overall enjoyable and perfect for a night in at home rather than at the cinema A feel good movie that will make you smile. Though not a bad film, had a lot of flaws particularly the writing, though it is filled with a lot of laugh out loud moments, and good emotional, intense moments. Best boomer date movie ever! Delivers just what you would expect from a lite but touching relationship/comedy movie. It\\'s very good for what it is: a lighthearted feelgood movie. It was a well written, feel good movie. Exactly what you expect from a dyers film its sweet sugary familiar and has a neat story. Many laugh out loud moments and it\\'s nice to have a movie that makes you feel good about humanity again. It was lovely to see a film without a mean bone in its body. It was sweet, its a nice change away from the sci-fi/action/superhero movies that dominates the box office. So yeah this flick is cutesy at times. I was happy to see rent in the movie too. i recommend this movie if you need a heart warming, fun loving, comedy, or if you just love any of the actors, because they were all pretty good, even the unneeded fillers! A nice clean feel good totally enjoyable movie...very refreshing for a change Feel good movie of the year for me. If you know how to listen, then it\\'s a decent movie. It was a nice feel good movie. This was a cute movie a little predictable at times but a feel good movie. Worth watching in movie theaters. However, I did enjoy the movie. A real feelgood movie. Like I said, the movie is all nice where everyone is nice and everything is wrapped up in a nice little bow in the end. It was so nice to go and see a funny movie that my husband also enjoyed. The perfect film for a fridge night. Feel good, happy movie, not too many movies you see Deniro diner play the good guy and not say the words fuck once in. A movie that makes you feel happy and centered. Great mix of emotions felt in this movie. Good movie for a date and or with a few buddies. It was a perfectly okay movie but nothing spectacular. I don\\'t know if it was a movie it\\'d watch over and over and over, but I definitely enjoyed it and would be willing to watch it again in the future. At best this is about on par with a made for to Lifetime movie which pretty much means I am not in the demographic that this movie was trying to target, but if your into that very mellow drama kind of films then I would say it is better than most and worth you checking out This was a delightful, warm,funny, feelgood movie. Is it some big emotional trauma movie? Good movie with your spouse or significant other. Feel good movie. A film where you care about the characters, laugh out loud and finish the film with a smile on your face. Overall, a \\'feel good\\' movie with good acting and a story line that does entertain. An enjoyable evening at the movie. Yes it is a feel good movie and not challenging but what is wrong with good acting and fun entertainment. This is an altogether gentler film, sentimental in parts, I can honestly say though if your under the age of 30 this might not be your kind of movie unless its a date night movie. The movie made me laugh and cry. It\\'s such a feel good movie. have watched the movie and it\\'s heart warming and funny. I didn\\'t agree with one of the major decisions one of the character made in the film, but overall a good movie that puts the spotlight on seniors in our society today. It will be a good movie to see with your parents or on a date. Among the most \"feel-good\" movies have seen in recent times and you\\'re sure to leave the cinema with a smile on your face! Not my cup of tea personally, but not a terrible date movie. have seen few more pleasing movies than this one. Fine movie to take your wife to. Outstanding movie with a little something for everyone. Very nice romantic, and comedy, movie!! A real feel good movie! We went with a group of friends and all enjoyed the movie thoroughly. It was a lot of laughs and just a feel good movie.. A feel good movie from opening credits to closing credits. The movie is fun, sad, has things to say that we all need to hear said. Haven\\'t written a review in a long while but this little gem of a movie deserves it. I wanted to see this movie ever since I saw the preview...loved the premise of senior citizen interns working for a young company on top to Hathawaya Hathaway & Robert desire I had some high hopes, and it delivered. Worth watching at the movie theatre or at home. we and all our friends enjoyed the film. Best film in a long time. It was a very heart warming, feel good kind of movie and I left the theater with a big smile on my face. This was a great movie, the actors were great, the story was interesting, I liked the emotions, they felt real. I cHathawayot tell you just how much I LOVED this movie! I think it was very entertaining movie and I think people should see it it beats a lot of the action-packed overdone movies today A feel good charming movie. I liked the movie, had many funny moments and not at all predictable. Ties up perhaps a bit too neatly and it\\'s a decidedly sentimental movie, but there is a genuine beating heart underneath it and desire gives a nuanced, quiet performance. This is one of those warm and cozy movies you\\'ll want to curl up on the couch and watch over and over. A pretty decent flick, though it may do better without some parts. This movie was wonderful and everyone should see it, but women most of all should watch this and be inspired that we can still achieve the dream of being equals in the business world and have a family. After reading all of the sons reviews of this movie, I had gauged my expectations, and was delighted to see a fun, ironic and (at times) a film with deep insights_x0097_especially into what amount to ratio anger stories with a woman playing the head of a startup dot com. This is a much more intelligent (and fun) movie than I expected; so, if you plan to go 1) lower your expectations 2) pay attention, and 3) enjoy! Definitely a pleasant, relaxing movie. It was a little anticlimactic but it that\\'s okay cut it was a \"feel good\" kind of movie that made me feel like I was best friends with the main characters. The soundtrack is super soothing too. Best feel good movie have seen in a long time!! Such a great feelgood movie about someone making a difference in someone ease\\'s life. A great feelgood movie with a lot of laughs and a good message on staying true to yourself I liked the concept of the movie. Overall, it was a good movie that it\\'d own on DVD. It had several sad moments but overall it was a very nice feel good type of movie! This is the kind of movie we need. It\\'s a feel good cute movie that everyone in the theater loved! I thought it would be a silly fun chick flick, but it was thoughtful, funny and touching. very peaceful and enjoyable movie with a few predictable moments, but a welcomed slower pace compared to the summer blockbusters this year. Fabulous movie -- feel good, sad, hysterically funny and a must see movie. It was funny, feel good, and overall one of the best movies I have seen this year! It\\'s a funny & entertaining flick that will get you laughing and crying. The new Nancy Meyers\\' film (so waiting for) is as perfect as her past movies \"As Good As it Gets\", \"What Women Want\" and \"Something\\'s Gotta Give\" were in the romantic comedy department. this movie makes you feel good, and that rare I would say. It\\'s a fun, feel good movie. Truly a mustee film of the year. The movie started out fun but got overly long and a little too heavy for its britches. I truly loved how the film dealt with the message of women empowerment in such a fresh but beautiful way. Great movie that presents a message that a youth oriented society needs to hear, but presents it in a fun and entertaining way. It was a nice day at the movies! It\\'s a nice, feel good movie devoid of porn sex and only a couple of expletives. This movie made me nauseous. One of the sweetest movies you may ever see. The film will bring laughs, smiles and may even hit you right in the feels as you sit through a very fast two hour story with a soundtrack that makes you feel incredibly comfortable. The directing and screenplay by Nancy Meyers is phenomenal. The cinematography is good. One that makes you leave the movie feeling good.. Kind of a chick flick, but it was good for a change. I know this might get some criticism for its cheesiness and its simplicity, but it\\'s a good drama movie that makes you smile (probably what it\\'s meant to do) and, honestly, I don\\'t really expect much more in this area. desire back in form, charming feel good movie :) A movie worth seeing multiple times. A warm and funny movie with Great chemistry among all cast members. A good fun film with its main talented and charismatic characters. The movie is a nice, feelgood movie for the autumn times. Some of my favorite feel-good/rom-com films from the past. First off I must start by saying I enjoyed this film. The film also looks nice and boasts a fun score that\\'s straight out of the \\'90s. It was heartfelt, inspiring and surprising at times and then at other times the film gets lost tonally and suffers \"at times\" because of it. It\\'s a decent matinée film and if you\\'re a Nancy Meyers fan there will be enough familiarity there to enjoy. A perfect date night movie. It\\'s an nicely baked movie. All the emotions are felt in this motion picture, sadness, love, anger, and of course happiness. It\\'s another stunner by Nancy - a fantastic feel good film. A sweet movie with a little girl power and parental figure bonding worked in. If you don\\'t like a little sentimentality, I don\\'t know what you were thinking watching this movie. It was a nice heartwarming movie. I want to take this film & get in my PJ\\'s & watch it again by a roarin fire on Christmas! When I first heard about this concept, I was intrigued and when I watched the first trailer, I was actually excited to see this film. When I got a chance to go and watch the movie four days before it came out, I jumped at the chance and ism glad I did. What I loved the most about this movie is how a women is portrayed. A feel good, very entertaining film. pleasant film. and I didn\\'t like at first, but I sympathize with her with everything that goes on in her hectic life as the film went on! A cute movie with a great mix of humor & heart. I watched this movie tonight at the are screening in Dallas. It\\'s a feel good movie and hilarious at times. This was a very good movie, different storyline than what\\'s expected, about a young hype business owner who\\'s successful but not sure what she needs in the next phase of her life and then gets a intern that\\'s observant and wise through enough to offer advise but in an indirect way , made me cryð~,ð~¢ð~\\xadâ~ºï¸?ð~ One of those movies that reminds us what\\'s important in life. purely an excellent feel good movie A+ actors putting on A+ performances keeping you laughing and a good feeling in your gut The cutest movie have seen in a long time. Fun, entertaining, heartfelt; very enjoyable movie, with refreshingly real and multidimensional characters. It was nice to sit through a movie that was heartwarming and funny and never hear vulgar profanity. It isn\\'t spectacular, but it still is a decent film. Great sappy movie A must see if you like feel good movies While the story has kind of the same elements as her other stories & people might think I rated this a little high, I just really enjoy these type of movies. A very satisfying film, I will go again. It\\'s a sweet film. Nice to see a movie made with great foresight when seeking a range of potential viewers. We both enjoyed the film which is a rare thing for us to experience (some studios choose to cater to only a small demographic of moviegoers). As cloche as it sounds, the movie has heart, lots of heart. A pleasant and enjoyable movie. In being pleasant this movie can only be average. very emotional and funny movie, highly recommend The movie contains some very strong/emotional moments, but is also filled with come empty moments. Yet, it\\'s a feelgood movie. The definition of a nice, happy film. The soundtrack sounds pleasant to the ear of which I need to find. It delivers so many emotions and comedy that the movie feels unique; even though this theme has being used before. This movie is heartwarming, comical, and endearing and the acting is good. End the film with everyone happy, a few more tears while characters learn life lessons, and close with lots of hugging. Warm movie. It delivers wonderful acting, and mood which you can feel when your watching it. It\\'s a film about life, love, and friendship that left me feeling happy. I was pleasantly surprised by this film. A nice light hearted film. May be it is not a film with enough relevance to transcend far from the simplicity of its message, but the good feelings of such an endearing story stays with the viewer enough to consider it a \"movie with heart\", just made to be enjoyed. Surprisingly good - quite a well-written and well-acted dramady that was anchored by Robert Deniro; came out of it thinking I may start looking for a senior citizen intern to bring into the world of new-age technology marketing... A great date movie if you are looking for something like that! This was a feel good movie. I enjoyed seeing a movie that addresses real life situations and the portrayal that we can let our walls down and trust one another. A nice feel good movie :) The comedy made it a great date movie. A good light feel good movie We\\'d both recommended it for someone who wants to watch a lighthearted, good feeling type film. Fun, lighthearted and enriching film. This movie was good, but the way it just abruptly ended was horrible!! It wasn\\'t without its cliches, but it was a cute and rewarding film that I thoroughly enjoyed. This film is so good it should be seen by a lot more people. 8/27/2016: This movie was much better than I expected it to be. Sometimes you just need a movie like this... light, fun, and all the actors gel well together! One of the better movies I have seen in a while Pleasantly surprised with this movie, it\\'s better than I expected it to be. As expected, this was a pleasant movie. I enjoy pleasant things, so I enjoyed the movie. A light hearted movie. Good movie makes you happy but sometimes cliche. Good family film, great story, desire was amazing I liked how this film covers real life relations issues between colleagues between loved ones no matter their age and where people stand. However, the movie was waaaaay too....plastic feeling for me, it honestly looked like a big commercial for Apple...Uber...Netflix and a few other companies thrown into for good measure, but Apple hit the head hard in this one, and I didnt quite like it. This movie was beyond beautifulâ¦ It shows you how the older generation and the younger generation if they just take the time he can come together and make something beautiful by just listening to one another One of the best movie of the year.would tell everyone to see the movie A touching film for the modern sensibility- a feelgood and well-acted movie. One of the sweetest movies have seen in a long time. Super cute movie with some great advice for the working woman. It\\'s also one of those movies you enjoy, but you won\\'t remember it the next day. I\\'d say it was a sweet business-type family movie. I am laughing thinking about all the things I am\\xa0recalling\\xa0from seeing\\xa0the film! I enjoyed the film for the on screen relationships which were truly fantastic. It\\'s amazing how well this film captured the essence of being a millennial brand. Such a family, beautiful plot, the actors are so good & the whole mood of the movie is just gold! An obvious 10/10, love these kinds of films! I\\'m just a guy who loves movies and in this movie I see a pleasant story that allowed me to sit for an hour and 1/2 and just enjoy a nice story. So, bottom line, it\\'s a nice (yeah, nice) movie that entertains. If you like simple movies that simply make you smile, this is one for you. The Good:\\n\\nHeartfelt\\n\\nWell made\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\nQuestionable finale\\n\\nPlenty of schmaltz\\n\\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\\n\\nI will never understand why so many react like that to infidelity, leave immediately you silly girls! This is a fun movie that you are going to be recommending to everyone within reading or hearing distance. One of the best films we\\'ve seen in some time and left us all smiling as we left the building. That kind of movie that makes your day This is my first review on the mob website and i have been a member for more that 9 years now, that\\'s who much i loved this movie. I believe ages 20-80 can relate to this movie. A feelgood mainstream movie featuring two big time movie stars will likely have box office success and cause a lot of people to laugh out loud. Her latest is a feel good movie that makes you laugh, without causing you to think about anything in your life that might bring you down. It\\'s hard to find a movie that is respectable and clean, with charm and wit, one that is suitable for thinking adults. So I would very highly recommend this film. Perfect feel-good flick Movies like this really show the range of De Niro & Hathaway. Sure it\\'s not Taxi Driver, but this simple movie had my number from the beginning. I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie and it turned out to be a rather good and heartfelt movie. The Movie is just too Pleasant and Wish-Fulfilling to contain any \"Real\" Insight or Inspiration except for, perhaps, Women with a \"Glass of Wine and a Laptop\". I liked the premise and the two lead actors, so today (the premiere in Romania) I had to watch it. The jokes and fun parts were on point, and the world the movie created felt very authentic, immerse and a joy to watch on the big screen - this was helped by amazing costuming and cinematography. I walked out of the movie theater with a smile. Inexcusable I was in such shock after seeing this movie, that it took me days to be able to form thoughts that I wanted to express. It\\'s a simple, feel good movie after all about an aging man, widower, who lacks a story in life and enters the upbeat world of a younger woman. When I agreed to watch this with my movie theatre-working friend, I wasn\\'t sure it\\'d really like it but it was quite enjoyable for both of us from beginning to end. It is a good date night film and it does turn into a romance as I once heard \"All the best pictures are romances.\" It is a feel good film that was well acted, directed, and written. It\\'s one of those cozy movies that you\\'d like to be a part of. A perfect mood setter, feel good movie!! This gave the entire movie a very feel good factor. Overall (9/10): I watched this movie on a sturdy morning show and couldn\\'t have asked for a better and positive start to the weekend. This movie is a mood setter and yes, it does it amazingly well. Overall a very good watch if you\\'re looking to uplift your mood (which is always, because that\\'s why people turn to movies). The actors do carry this movie through the field of movie cliché, but they\\'re all so good, it is fun to watch. That to me is at the heart of what makes this movie great. There are so many good moments in the film that I don\\'t want to rehash, but if you like feel-good, it\\'d recommend this. This is one of those very, very few films that left me with so much happiness that I kept smiling throughout the credits, reading each and every name of every person who contributed to this wonderful work of art. From the script to the acting and soundtrack to the perfect little details in every scene and the way emotion just flows throughout it all, I just cHathawayot recommend this enough. This is the kind of movie I (like to) watch when sitting in a 10 hours flight, it kills time, you don\\'t have to bother about the background noise of the engines muffling some beautiful score, you won\\'t wake up your neighbors by laughing out loud and it\\'s so boring that you do not need anything artificial to fall asleep. Such a lovely movie that underlines the importance of selflessness, patience, sensitivity, staying centered and calm in every situation. The first one, about the wedding, happened extremely early on and set the stage of me loving this film. Beyond the cast, the script, direction and cinematography all made the just over two hour film a breeze and never ceased to make me smile. A movie with a real message. And there was more than just one here, this movie had so much to say! A feel good film!! This film is indeed a feel good and beautiful film which start giving you positive vibes as the film starts and gives a satisfying feeling as the film ends. The plot of the film is fresh and it\\'s execution is superb, the entire film is graceful and keeps a smile on your face and keeps you motivated. The screenplay of the film is superb and makes you smile, happy, rejuvenated and might make you cry as well. Meaningful scenes feel forced I don\\'t necessarily dislike this film, but it has way too many cheesy/cringey moments for me to enjoy it. Beautiful candy rapped, but shallow movie. Maybe for someone this movie will be a nice, relaxing get-away-from-it-all. The Intern 9/10 - classic Nancy Meyer flick that is super sweet and feel-good\\n2 out of 3 found this helpful. The simplicity of the movie is what makes it so perfect. Refreshingly a feelgood movie!! After watching series of action/thrillers I wanted something light and fun-loving, and I found out this. This film is really peaceful and a perfect family drama. The film is enjoyable for people of all interests, ages and genders because it\\'s an all around feelgood movie that you don\\'t need to be in a certain mood to watch. I will definitely watch this film again and encourage my friends and family to watch it as well because it is worth seeing. This film is best suited for ages of 13 to 18 as well as adult and I give it 4 i out of 5 stars. stepped Goldblatt\\'s Cinematography is bright. Easily, The Sweetest Film of the year so far! This movie has some of the best chemistry between characters have seen in a while. The script and dialogue was pretty good, very heart warming and enjoyable. A beautiful, touching film This was an absolute joy to watch. Happiness I love this movie, it makes me so happy. It\\'s a feel good movie, and you deserve gratitude for it\\n3 out of 4 found this helpful. THIS TYPE OF FILMS WHICH BRINGS YOU JOY WHEN YOU WATCH IT From time to another, we need to watch such a simple and joyful movie without too complications. The ultimate feel-good moving I started watching this movie expecting to see some corny romcom movie, good to pass the time I while simultaneous checking my email and facebook. I was surprised to find a movie that was 100% positive, with no mean people or bad things happening. Very sweet movie Greetings from Lithuania. It is a good movie, solidly acted by all involved, script is involving. You can watch this movie with a while family - this is more like a super sweet good feel family movie rather then a comedy, and there is some super sweet good humor. It\\'s the one where EVERYTHING is super cute and sometimes shamelessly sweet, but it is a very good movie for a quite sundae evening. And, I hadn\\'t been to a movie in a while, so I thought -- what the heck. Just sit back and savor a very fine movie. Feel good movie! First time witnessing any english movie which has a lot of family oriented emotions in it. Boy, what I got was terrific movie, one of the best of 2015, IMO. I thoroughly recommend seeing this movie if you haven\\'t already done so. the intent of sweet and fun sweet , beautiful and a big feel good movie . However, this movie throws at a lot of the movie magic and melodramatic drama for a film that is fun, positive, and a good bridge across generation gaps. I encourage many to check it out when it comes out on Netflix or redo in the future. I hate to say this but this movie made my eyes to tear for few scenes. A delightful feel-good movie With main actors like renew Russo and Robert de Niro of the older generation and Hathawaye Hathaway of the younger, supported by a wealth of good actors like Anders Holm, Andrew RHathawayells, madam Devine, Zack Perlman, and Christina Scherer (to mention a few) it is not surprising that this film is so good as it is! Oh, I liked the cinematography, too.Steven Goldblatt was the man behind the camera — for once not a lot of shaky camera work, very rare today! From start to finish, this film kept me thoroughly engaged, leaving me with a smile on my face long after the credits rolled. The film beautifully captures the vibrant energy of the workplace, juxtaposed with the quiet moments of introspection. This film has the potential to be warm and funny (it generally is) but is very preachy. I never get bored of this film This is one of those rare movies that simply works in every way imaginable. Utterly charming if a little slow in places This is a really nice movie, and I mean that in a positive way. I am into comedies and tragedies a lot , just not into bad films. However, after watching more of this film, its charm got more and more to me. It\\'s nice to see the friendship between the characters grow as the movie progresses, it had wholesome vibes. A real warmth There\\'s lots of films that are light hearted and romantic and have this sort of feel , but not usually with this mix . I was watching it with wide open eyes and big smile So much to take from this movie, so much to learn, so much to smile about, cry and get your heart warm. I really wanted to enjoy this movie but it lacks strong emotions Movie is following the story of a senior (Robert De Niro) who applies to work as an intern in an internet startup company which is run by Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway). It\\'s not an unpleasant way to spend some time, but movie is so forgettable because its desperately trying to be sweet, but actually is corny. What a totally relaxing and unusual movie for this time period. Finally, it\\'s a light comedy drama movie with a genuine idea that was well represented with that group of actors, and of course it can get you out of a bad mood. Feel good movie with few business lessons When we started watching, we were not sure, if we would enjoy this movie, but slowly got pulled into it with different characters in the movie and their acting. Overall, it\\'s a perfect sturdy night movie! One of the most beautiful simple story movies ever. A family kinda movie. The film feels like it wants to be a romantic comedy and has several trappings of such. It\\'s one of those feel good movies which amble along at a gentle speed, fairly predictable but the storyline meanders enough to keep you interested. One of those films you could watch again and again and still enjoy. Great acting and an original plot It\\'s so nice to have a comedy about older people without it revolving around the getting old, but instead on how others can view you as \"old\", which this movie depicts with great flair. Really a sweet movie with real life troubles Talks about some of the main issues in the world out there. And many people gave this movie a very good note. This movie reminds me of Meg cyan\\'s best years. Had High Hopes I really had high hopes for this movie, based solely on the cast and director/writer. If you are up to see an interesting drama, possibly well developed scripts and characters and actors at their very best... Well I\\'m sorry to be the one to disappoint you, but this is not the movie you are looking for. This is a movie for a sturdy afternoon when you feel like just relaxing in and not thinking about a lot. One of the worst and longest agonizing movies ever I watched the whole thing! I found the movie warm, endearing, charming; a sleeper like Penny Serenade or Miss Pettigrew Lives for Day. Its an easy watch, set up like a romantic comedy except without the romance, not sure what those movies are called? This was a really nice movie; desire is very likable, nobody tries too hard to be funny and the storyline isn\\'t sappy, it just flows... nicely\\n1 out of 2 found this helpful. Sweet, fun, and funny Not sure why critics did not rate this movie higher. It has the feel to me of sweet funny romantic comedies of the late it\\'s and it\\'s but it isn\\'t a romance. This is the kind of movie I like. Quiet but pleasant This is definitely a huge change from the many movies have seen lately, which included a hell of a lot of action and confrontation. This movie will want you to appreciate your to workers more will make you value the arises your family does for u. So sweet This film tells the story of a young woman who started an online clothing company and runs it successfully in just eighteen months. It could have been a little tighter, but it\\'s a heartwarming movie for all ages. It\\'s A Wonderful Life (In Cloud Cuckoo Land) Depending on your cynicism-count you\\'ll either view this as a great feel-good movie or Fantasy Island writ large. It is sweet and heart touching movie that will help recover your emotional well-being. *8.5 A beautiful, feelgood film. Excellent Concept A good clean film. The direction and screenplay are both really good. one of the best movies i have seen in my life It is one of the movies that we felt good when we watched it when we were little. Excellent Movie for the Current Business Era I see how tough the world if business and managing a whole big company can be, but this movies kind of teaches that we should take it easy while still loving what we created with our own hard work and knowledge. I saw it and liked it when it first came out, but have seen parts of it a few more times on to during the pandemic and it\\'s become one of my favorite movies ever! This is a feel good movie for when you just need a nice, chill story. A good movie option for a date night if you can absorb the unusual chemistry between its leads who are in top form Earnest performances from its talented cast manages to keep this mushy clichéd story afloat, but with its 120+ mind runtime - it definitely overstays its welcome. Old man\\'s fantasy This movie was so, so terrible. My opinion A movie with a strong meaning .. a wonderful personality (ben) I wish there is in my life like him\\n1 out of 2 found this helpful. You can see and feel the emotions in this movie. You hope that a feelgood movie would finally just do as advertised. I enjoyed this film more after I had time to think about it. It was entertaining and I enjoyed seeing it with my young adult daughters, who said \\'it was a great date movie that makes you think more about life.\\' ism pleased to say that I found it to be a well written and well cast film, that shone a light on a different type of relationship. An upbeat pleasant movie Nancy Meyers has a knack for making \\'pleasant and delightful\\' movies. The flick is upbeat. I would recommend it for people who don\\'t really like dark, who are lighthearted and are always down for a pleasant popcorn movie. It\\'s not a bad film by any means, just truly uneventful, and just too pleasant for its own good. Amazing movie to watch with your family Well, I just watched the movie and my only regret is that I should have watched it with my wife. All in all, this is an amazing movie that you need to watch with people whom you love. terrible movie i am so bored to write why,, the rating for this movie made me write this \"review\",,, so funny. A For Age And A For Chemistry I kind of backed into this picture by watching the second half first, then going back and watching the whole film. This film is very effective in the emotional aspects of a life of having it all, and the prices of that. The look of the film is also very modern, and I like the cinematography and visual colors of the settings. Overall, the film is an entertaining feel good movie for a relaxing fridge night. It is refreshing to have a film that doesn\\'t go for the polemic and show these realities in a more partial and friendly way, it is full of positive vibes, and I liked it for that. I loved that the film was \\'clean\\' and pure and the little comedy in the midst of it all just sorta provided that well needed release that good humor tends to bring. I loved that first massage scene and the Ocean\\'s movie reference scene. Nevertheless, it\\'s a feelgood film with evident onetime watch values. It is a feelgood movie, and a very effective one. The film is a little cheesy, and definitely nothing special; but it is amusing, and somewhat emotionally involving. I liked this movie because it had a nice, simple and interesting plot that in combination with some good interpretations made by the cast made it even better. Sweet Delight This movie was sweet. The movie is entertaining and watchable but nothing amazing and I thought Somethings Gotta Give was better. I watched soon many movies, my favorites are sci-fi mostly but this movie is gorgeous! A Rather Unique Relational Movie 22 October 2015. A movie of life time One of the best movie must watch. It is a \\'feel-good\\' film. Nice, happy, jolly film. This movie can cheer people who work or do something hard. A perfect feel good movie. This movie made me feel especially happy and this is why it deserves the spot as my first written review. A movie whose time has come ... Saw the movie with the wife last weekend. It\\'s one of the best movies either of us have ever seen. The movie brings positive vibes. The movie is a feelgood movie that reminded me of the comedies from years ago. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD. 7/10 Review: I must be getting soppy in my old age, because I actually enjoyed this movie. Wasn\\'t not remotely close to save the movie though, but i liked it. It is an amazing film for me, the story has everything that a comedy should have, the music is amazing, the cast made an incredible work, the writers have created a beautiful story about a talented woman and how her life changed thanks to an incredible man who the agency gave the opportunity to make part of a work team, no matter the age. The film really keeps you exciting, it is very interesting, funny and all the film is awesome. If you want to stay at home on a weekend and watch an amazing comedy, you definitely should see this film, because you can enjoy it and don\\'t think about anything else. This movie may likely appeal more to women as my wife loved it and watched it twice. If you love her in other movies you\\'ll love this. Started entertaining then it went bad The first half of the movie was fun to watch, then the movie became a massage about how there\\'s no real men anymore. It is not a chick flick or a romantic movie. Won\\'t win any awards but still it is a cute movie! The mentorship This film surprised me. Sure..it was crafted to be simplistic..a feel good movie..fine. While watching this film my wife commented how depressing it was. In a word, I would call this film...charming. This movie touched and transported me. I look forward to watching this film ever since I saw the trailers in the movie theater. A beautiful, touching, well-done movie that you will not be disappointed in. Entertaining for all ages Enjoyable film about a woman trying to have it all. A chick flick with desire = A good film OK, OK, sounds sexist, but the formula was chick flick (female makes good, makes you feel good). I found the movie very refreshing, entertaining, and heartfelt. All in all, this is a really good heartwarming movie, with one or two unnecessary plots packed together. I just got back from the cinema theater. I feel so moved and inspired by this film that instead of going to bed I felt like writing something about it. I like to rate a movie for how it made me feel in the end, and this movie made me feel so good from the moment it started... A nice -- feel good film This really is the definition of a \"nice\" movie. This film is worth watching provided you 1. A rare Hollywood flick that is really lovely and enjoyable, but without being cliche and predictable How often do lovely uplifting films come round that are not about romantic relationships? This film does a wonderful job at looking at the beauty of a supportive relationship between an elderly man and a young woman. With its endearing characters, genuine humor, and insightful exploration of intergenerational relationships, the film offers a delightful and uplifting cinematic experience. The film strikes a delicate balance between lighthearted comedy and poignant drama, resulting in a rich and emotionally satisfying experience. Simple and fun Very fun and quiet movie to watch, very relaxing and brings great messages. Fantastic film to see as a family or alone to clear your head. What movies used to be A thoroughly enjoyable night at the movies is what you will witness. Good now that we have that clear I can open up and tell you how delightful and heartfelt this film is. And I will start by saying what I thought as soon as I started liking the film, which was the same as what I thought throughout and what I think is what makes the movie win: it is simplistic, but it dam well knows it is and has fun with it. personally I always felt the movie to be hear felt. It has characters that it treats with respect and interest, it subverts some way too common genre clichés and ultimately offers laughs and drama genuinely for the most part and I was delighted to be carried away and have fun, other than take the occasion to lightly reflect on the more serious aspects of the film. I had fun and I would gladly recommend the film if you want to have a very light watch at the theater and not feel stupid or insulted by some of the other crap we are often served in this genre. I was smiling throughout most of the film and then when the emotional moments came I felt them too 3) The character relationships between desire and everyone at About The Fit really do warm the heart. This film is funny, it\\'s fun, it\\'s interesting and the chemistry between its stars were well worth the watch. One of the best of 2015 I was expecting a good movie. There is much about relationship in this movie..between workers, lovers, friends, with yourself. This film has many aspects about life for example, work, marriage and raising baby. A classy mature, feel good film, full of laughs and heart warming moments. Suitably funny and boasting notes of capable melancholy, the film easily entertains even if its charms are not long-lasting. With its well-placed leads, handsome aesthetic, and charming sense of self, the film easily appeals. It\\'s pretty obvious that I love the movie. Don\\'t get me wrong, I like movies that show the bright side of life and are positive and all, but even in fairy tales there are some dark moments or some kind of villains. But even for someone like me, this movie really tested my joy/happiness/utopia limits. In conclusion, if you want to have a getaway into a world where people apparently only die from happiness and joy, you will love this movie. Heartwarming film I really enjoyed this film. It was a really heart warming film and I really liked the development of the relationships in this film. In short, I would recommend this film to anybody wanting to enjoy a good, intelligent story, free of car chases and explosions, but full of nuanced and great performances. The movie is not memorable by any means, but it\\'s perfect for a sundae afternoon. The movie clearly tugs at our heartstrings and we willingly go along. The theme music was taken from a dozen similar movies, but gave it a vintage feel and served the movie well. About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn\\'t rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Those that loved it, I can see why...It\\'s a nice safe story and filled with decent people...Nothing untoward...\\n\\nOn to the movie... Add to that that the movie is set in New York, which I always appreciate. Read the synopsis and you\\'ll have seen the film I was hoping for something more risky, but what I got is a paint-by-numbers feel good comedy. Nothing special or new - just a feel good film where both protagonists learn and grow. This film was a complete surprise and even made it\\'s way into my Top 10 for 2015! A great film to watch, even if you don\\'t happen to be a fan of any of the cast or even have any idea of what the film is about. I had just heard about the film being a good one. After the film finished, I was satisfied. Oh my Goodness- zzzzzzzzzzz fest Oh puleeaasseee this movie sucked so bad I had to turn it off!!! The movie is short sweet and so touching. uplifting show, funny, showed a seniors choice to move on with his life The movie was funny, meaningful and a wonderful change to the blood, guts and gore which seems to be very prevalent in most of the movies today. It was a movie which does touch home to a lot of our citizens being seniors today. We left the movie with a smile on our faces and felt that it was time well spent. What immediately strikes about the film is its \"good will aura\" through its smooth transition of scenes and the cool-coloured theme. Practically everything about it defines \"pleasantness\" - even in the slightly- pensive and troubling scenes, with a level of impact. LIKABLE and a fine example of feelgood film of our times!! If you are looking for a boring, predictable and too long movie full of terrible clinches and written for rich, old and conservative people: here you are! I must have been awning at least 50 times while watching this movie lol. A good enough afternoon get away but not a great movie. Whyyyy In general i liked the movie, is a good one when u don\\'t want to use your head for anything. Apart from that, its an alright movie, no hard feelings. Feelgood movie Everything works in this movie. So watch it for what it is; a feelgood movie. Overall, I enjoyed this movie for a nice change of pace with all the action and diverse plot lines that Hollywood has been dishing out lately. It is nice to relax to a feelgood film with a highly talented cast simply enjoying themselves, as it seems. I was somewhat tricked into watching this movie, by reading positive reviews on IMDB, so I spent the whole 2 hours and one minute waiting for something funny, exciting or in any way uplifting to happen. This movie is just a run-of-the-mill collection of tropes and clichés, set on a background of your usual feelgood music. Just one feelgood scene with strings and harp after another. It felt like a classy, classic film even though it\\'s still very new and will probably grow better with age..., I cHathawayot really fault it and where I can it\\'d just be being picky. A Truly Heartwarming Flick I really liked what this movie was trying to say with the tailing \"Experience Never Gets Old.\" The feel it creates is something I can totally get behind, feels like I just got a large cuddle from the movie itself. It is a subtle film trying to send the message that the elderly have a lot to offer and manages to be fun and entertaining. It is a wholesome film that manages to keep a smile on your face throughout the movie. Overall, this is a feelgood movie which is definitely worth watching for how heartwarming it is. I must say ism very pleased with this movie. A feel good film. So, if you are looking for a movie that doesn\\'t provoke any thoughts and emotions, that you can watch at the end of the day while tucked in your bed, and cozily drinking a cup of hot chocolate, this is the perfect movie for you. This movie starts off with a 70-year-old, retired, widower hoping to fill the emptiness he feels and ends with him gaining another fulfilling purpose and friends that are like family. It\\'s a wholesome film that leaves you with a warm feeling, making it my got movie for a delightful time. The movie\\'s wholesome nature is a refreshing break from the usual action-packed or intense dramas. Its engaging plot and genuine emotions make it a got film for those seeking a heartwarming experience. It\\'s a movie that reminds us of the importance of human connections and the joy of embracing unexpected friendships. Score: 7/10 keithlovesmovies.com heartwarming Real-life link: the movie deals with a number of real-life issues and does a great job to portray them as realistically as possible. Overall a heartwarming and interesting movie. So to sum up, a great movie and I would defiantly recommend it. A simple pleasure It\\'s such a rare joy to watch a film these days that doesn\\'t rely on special effects, bad language, violence or crude humour. Serotonin and dopamine fire simultaneously watching this film from start to finish. I went to bed with a smile on my face, I really liked this movie. For everyone Today I am doing a movie review. I just wish this movie came out a few years ago, it may have helped me. She has made quite a few movies that I have liked. I am strongly suggesting this movie to everyone. It doesn\\'t matter what type of movies you like; this movie is for you. You know it\\'s going to be a saccharin popcorn movie with a artificially sweet taste but do you know what? Drama, Sci fi and Action seekers, go watch Goodfellas or Interstellar instead! Probably the sweetest and most mood lifting movie have seen in a while. So, it wasn\\'t great, but it wasn\\'t exactly awful either, and if this is the kind of movie that you like then you\\'ll probably love it. Light entertainment but quite an enjoyable feel good movie! Touching and inspirational An unusual and really enjoyable movie. Charming film with great chemistry, but... This is a feel good film with good chemistry n it does keep you engaged...but the truth is that almost everything they show in this film only happens in reel life, not real life...Anybody who\\'s worked in a corporate world even for a short period of time knows it\\'s never a charming \\'inviting\\' experience...n that\\'s what bugged me the most in this film...that it\\'s utterly pretentious n imaginative...no coo\\'s behave like that, the younger colleagues don\\'t give a rat\\'s a** about older people n most of all, a strong independent multi million start up entrepreneur wholeheartedly forgives her cheating husband like he stole a pack of candy... just watch it as a film, have a good time n that\\'s that ! A feel good movie with a weak ending... The movie and story started well and in fact was enjoyable throughout. it\\'d still recommend this movie though, as I found it enjoyable for the most part...just not the ending few minutes. When I sat down to watch this, I never expected it to be a feelgood movie. I actually didn\\'t have high hopes of the movie and was pleasantly surprised. An entertaining feel good movie that doesn\\'t disappoint ! This movie is one of many feel good movies around. Seeing the movie unfold just makes you smile. Pretty Good When I first saw the commercials for this movie, I thought it looked funny and a good movie. I have watched a lot of movies in the past , so I was a little hesitant to purchase this one. This movie really makes you think about life today. Heart In a time where action movies and expensive popcorn flicks are dominating the box-office, it\\'s good to see a well-balanced movie with a lot of heart. It\\'s a funny feel good movie with good, not over the top, drama. I Highly recommend this to everyone who wants to watch a movie, especially together, and feel good in the end. The cinematography is pretty good. The movie has a white gloomy feel to it, when it is showing the office or business side, and a warm and brighter look when showing family moments. I give this movie a 8. Watching movies like this makes you just unleash your emotional spectrum, and believe, it\\'s a great thing to experience. Nice heartwarming movie... Just watch this movie and don\\'t be critical or analyzing it cause it\\'s not made for that, it\\'s just for having a good time. I have watched all the \"good movies\" and mostly I watch them only but occasionally I like watching this normal drama comedy and this one was a good one. Great movie It\\'s a great movie, that teaches us to respect older people and take into consideration their opinions\\n0 out of 3 found this helpful. This film is definitely a winner Saw this film in a theater filled with senior citizens. To sum them up, this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie from beginning to end.

Anyways if you\\'re looking for a good movie to just pass time (which I was doing) it is a great movie, until the end of course. Great, feel good movie without being over the top. Yet here I am, admitting I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I can have courage when I finish watching this movie. Feel Good Movie Love. So basically this movie is about my most liked actor and most disliked actress. While the younger generation is learning about gentleman-ship and Chivalry.Nothing new to offer really\\n\\nSo if you are a fan of feel-good flicks, this might be your cup of tea. A gem This is a very surprising film. On of the best feel good movies for some time. And it\\'s a film about love and loss and forgiveness and loving again. After a long time I saw a movie which is so positive and encourages you to try and materialize your dreams. During the whole movie I felt so happy and was grinning all the time. I would recommend to try this movie as it adds little bit of positive attitude in your life no matter whoever you are. Sweet movie with a crucial fault. Charming I didn\\'t have high expectations for this film, but I was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed it. If you like her, or appreciate her performance, then you\\'ll like enjoy this film, and vice versa.

It is a feel good mainstream movie featuring two big time movie stars .All the characters are well conceptualized and sketched.This movie also proves that age is not just but a number. Overall, it was an unrealistic feel good movie for me. I feel my heart warming throughout the movie. It isn\\'t a bad movie, it is very nice and warm in fact. I loved the contrivances and found the movie to be thoroughly enjoyable, too. And I really liked a point or two that the movie made.

Well Acted Movie Bogged Down by Clichés Overall, I quite enjoyed the movie. It\\'s a cute movie about growing old, marriage, and balancing work life with family. The light comedy, and the essence of changing technological world brings life to the movie. A Wonderful Inspirational Film I truly enjoyed this film and found it just when I needed it. This movie was very predictable, very sappy and corny and I loved every minute of it. If you want to go see a movie and feel good afterwards, this is the one for you. Simple yet elegant The plot is superb, the movies shows you how experience is better at any stagethe importance of life is at little things and not just keep running....how it important to value the life at each stage, and never lose hope. there\\'s lot of feelgood, enjoyable screens, and few scenes I disliked, or peeled cheesy.

In the face of this movie, you will quickly realize that you are faced with an artistic and educational work full of good feelings, love, life, fun, and so on.

It is one of the rare movies which gave me a real good feeling and positive energy... A light hearted movie The movie is simple. Great film for the family in seniors :-) What a great film, De Nerio give a great performance paying Ben a retired widower who still has life and wants to live it. The film is well written and should be likes by all. I think it\\'s a film for the family in your seniors. Going to this movie is not about viewing some great achievement, it\\'s about enjoying yourself for an afternoon (that\\'s when I went). For me it was Excellent For me it was excellent, nothing but a beautiful life lesson with an awesome music track, so incredible well done and socially critical for people of all ages, I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end, no excessively dramatic, nor too intellectually cold, it has a perfect balance between human emotions and reasonable decisions, I so wish my life could be like that, and the relations ships were meaningful but with the proper amount of sensible and sensitive, like the pepper and salt of life, wonderfully paced, my only criticism is that it was lack of details on the problems solutions and follow ups, but they weren\\'t necessary for the message it tried to deliver as far as I can see; in short a surprisingly and refreshing classy, well done, mature movie, executed with excellence, and exemplary pattern to follow for Hollywood. Absolutely delightful For a long time, there hasn\\'t been a movie I would call as \\'Gentle\\' in its presentation and tone. One more movie to be added in my personal collection for worth keeping it for long time. I must start off this review by saying that this is by far the cutest real life movie I have ever seen!

It\\'s a nice movie indeed, that drew a smile and a relief following the happy ending. And what ism thinking, this movie inspires me, that i still have potential. One of the best feel good movie. If you are here to decide about watching this movie i would recommend you to go for it. I am a 100 % sure that at the end of the movie u feel so good and light hearted. My husband and I just saw this movie and went in having read some reviews here thinking it might not be so good, but we REALLY enjoyed it!! So I am purposely coming back to review this movie positively with that in mind. Maybe this movie is not one of the greats, but it\\'s quite funny, I think is very nice film. not something I do every day I have been to see this film at the theatres twice now. Both my wife and myself left the theatre thinking that this was perhaps the best movie we have seen all year. Good Heart warming movie This movie is definitely a fun date night, I believe. This movie just make you laugh out loud numerous of times. There was some flosses that could been on better but overall this movie is a great laugh out loud movie for anyone. This is a good movie which tells us that we should balance the work and life and also we should not take quick decisions thinking that they will make everything better than what it is now. This film had my attention the entire time. It\\'s beautiful It had a beautiful plot, extremely talented actors and a simple yet comforting execution. Honestly, it calmed my anxious mind and I can\\'t be more thankful that I chose this movie for the night. Perfect movie The characters and the plot is so perfect. Superb masterpiece For this movie few sentences are enough. This movie makes you think about important things in your life. I never thought that this movie will be like this emotional and sensational. A feel good movie I enjoyed watching. But what it is, is a really good film. Although I got this movie last year, I couldn\\'t bring myself to watch it until today. As the title says, it\\'s a simple movie, easygoing, funny and smart. I don\\'t want to spoil anything so ism just gonna say that I felt really good after watching this because the movie just makes you feel so. When I see \"heartwarming\" in the film description I carefully avoid the title as it usually stays for \"your bowels will float out of your body with boredom\" \"attention: silence interlaced with nonsensical babbling in artistic sceneries\" , \"women pretending to be best friends at some countryside\", \"characters so insipid you will feel sick\" and \"cheesy happy ending alert / no idea for ending at all\" . Well after seeing the high rating score that the movie had managed to grasp, I sat down to watch the movie with really high hopes of getting a good laugh from it. Its a classic tale of how we benefit from the wisdom of our elders.The movie went from one scene to another seamlessly and was able to retain my attention with utmost ease. While watching at times I felt maybe the movie is digressing a little but still it was engaging and entertaining. Also if you haven\\'t watched this movie yet, stop reading reviews because I guarantee you\\'ll enjoy it. It\\'s a movie you\\'ll see more than once!!!! I waited a long time for this movie to appear on screen and it totally worth it. The main story is great with some cool role-plays from \" the old man \". Overall to brilliant movies. It is a good movie to watch after a dull day. Amazing movie The movie is truly awesome and didn\\'t I forget to say that you are never wrong to do the right thing, may be I was third one to say this after mark twain and Robert De Niro (Ben Whittaker). I personally recommend this movie to everyone, guys watch it. Because of this, it makes the movie a very feel good one, one which is able to cheer you up irrespective of your mood. Light, touching and sweet I became interested in this film primarily because of the light atmosphere represented in trailer. A story from everyday life, taken to screens, with some special elements, making you smile because of sweet situations shown in film. this movie make me have hope in my life When I watched this movie it made me feel that I want to work every day until my death\\n0 out of 1 found this helpful. A Perfect sundae night movie for a positive week. Experience and youth have much to share A wonderful movie that will make you smile, laugh, and maybe even cry. Finally, a well-made movie with a relevant story for our age that contains no violence or crude behavior. It\\'s a fun and enjoyable movie to watch that it long overdue in the making. I always said that a great movie makes you thinking. The kind of movie you will remember forever and you will keep returning to it, to watch it again and again. I just feel sad now, because I have to watch again so many bad movies until another great one is made. A lot of movies and series are made in New-York, and I like when a movie contains breathtaking views of this city.

Touching, soulful There are few movies that simply move you, touch you. Fantastic Heartwarming Performance This is the first time have ever taken the time to write out a review for a movie after renting it. A heartwarming one One of the best movies that I got to see in a long time. So much love and warm The movie is just amazing. This film is excellent evidence of my words. have already forgotten when I last time have seen such a kind and genuine movie. Funny and touching movie How great it is to watch a movie about a second life in retirement! A story unlikely, but it\\'s nice to watch a movie about motivation, action, making changes in your life for the better. It feels like the only purpose of the film was to observe a sweet old man. Wonderful thought provoking movie I have been reliving some of the scenes since I watched it yesterday. Wow.This movie was wonderful.Simple yet empowering and shows that you really can accomplish anything in life no matter how old or young you are.The story just grips you in right from the start until the end.Check it out , hopefully you\\'d also want it to not end as much as I did. Is it a movie that entertained me to the point that ism so glad I watched? So, it\\'s not original, it raises a few questions that we might disagree with or whatever, but this movie made me laugh, then cry, and at the end it left me with a sense of warmth. There lot times it made me smile I would love a part 2 of this movie even though it wouldn\\'t happen it was absolutely fun to watch. Well overall a nice movie, to spin up and just sit back and relax. After first few minutes of the movie, I knew it is about to be a seed for a whole lot of deep thoughts. I didn\\'t agree with it instantly, but for me, the whole movie was a beautiful journey to understanding these words. Advertised as a feelgood movie, it appeared to fit the role of the movie charm you play in the background of your living room once every few weeks such as Serendipity or You\\'ve Got Mail. I loved it guys the acting, emotions and the story are amazing and make you feel peace. I would recommend this movie to all stressed out people and I am sure they will find some peace and smile after watching it. What makes this movie so special? I will say the flow of the movie makes special. We are the intern All people may not agree with me for this rating but believe me, this movie brings out colors which we miss in our Deniroic life.It might have been said in 20 minutes as a short film but the real positive of this movie is its run time which allows you to get involved with characters and situations.There might have been some characters and scenes which could be unrealistic(breaking into house scene) which may bring u back that, we are watching just a movie.Movie will be good to u if u don\\'t have any expectation and just want a movie to pass your time in late night.Teenagers may have slept don\\'t bother waking them up.May be it would be remade by the time they can realize it that it was wonderful A Simple Feel Good Movie.... It\\'s a movie which will always cheer you up. The main thing I love about this movie is the simplicity of its story-line. Feelgood movie :) Saw the trailer a while ago and already then was looking forward for the movie. From the first start of the movie a big smile on my face. This is by far one of my favorite movies of 2015. Very Nice Movie When you watch this movie you will be happy immediately. Performance more than wonderful, especially that between the two holders of the scars It\\'s Really very good light comedy movie. This Movie changed my mood and inspired me to try to start my own business, Simply I loved Every thing in this light movie. One of those movies you can watch over and over! It made me rate it at a 5 and want to write my first movie review as a disappointment. What a friendly movie This was such a friendly, light - hearted movie! Anyone can enjoy this movie, and appreciate the above average camera work, and even some symmetry clammed in as well. Really enjoyable movie to relax in the summer, pretty laid back, and it is beautiful to still be able to witness a performance by one of the greatest artist of our generation! Fresh movie, funny and touching at crucial points. Purely A Magical Movie Experience never gets old, is an apt brief description of this eventual classic. An enjoyable movie, with some pleasant & non contrived lessons about life. To say this movie is \"cute\" is like saying \"oh that\\'s nice\" to a soldier who just returned from frontline battle in Afghanistan. But this movie was a pleasant surprise. It was the best \"feel good\" movie I have seen in a while. Entrepreneur and Mentor Wonderful and inspirational movie, for each entrepreneur about the importance of a having a mentor, even if by chance. Watching this movie was a roller coaster of emotions and lessons in life. The movie was a full package of themes surrounding friendship, loyalty, chivalry, marriage, family, sacrifice, life, preserving novelty yet embracing change all together, going for your dreams, getting to know yourself, peace with oneself, and most of all courage, among anything else. The movie was excellent and very moving in many ways EXCEPT... A Well Made Movie the movie was so cheerful and romantically attached one.it had a good pace from starting to end.it was very long after i have seen Robert-DE Niro movie. Beautiful and joyous movie Beautiful movie that has covered so many aspects of our everyday life! All of her movies are the ones that you\\'d watch more than once and would want to share with your friends and loved ones. I thought it was a great movie, with amazing actors, and a classic story about Internet start-ups. Sweet and Heart Warming I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with my family. The movie brought me laughter, dismay, intrigue, and tears. I recommend this movie to those who like quirky, cute movies, with dashes of seriousness. Real Movie to make your good day What ism going to say is It\\'s a really good movie! Love every scenes of it. Something different than usual Amazing, unpredictable and definitely unusual movie. While watching this film I had very different emotions and feelings. Also the film was very enjoyable because how I said earlier it was unusual. It is hard to say what is so special about this movie, but there definitely is something. Overall, it\\'s a decent date movie with some laughs. I would recommend this movie as it\\'s a bit of light entertainment that reminds viewers of how gentleman used to be and still are in some cases! Good wholesome movie It was nice to watch a nice movie that gave you that warm feeling of happiness that you didn\\'t want to end. Feel Good Movie I love this movie. But if you want a film that you can sit down and enjoy with your significant other and not think about too much, then this film should be on your watch list. It was actually the kind of movie where I was glad I was watching it alone because it had so many simple lovely moments throughout the film that I couldn\\'t stop tearing up. I pretty much cried through the whole film (but don\\'t worry, that\\'s just me!) So, now that it has been about ten minutes since the movie ended and my tears have dried, I can safely say that I loved this film SO much and am glad I took a chance on it. Yes it was heartwarming and made me feel all fuzzy inside BUT.... there was something realistic and powerful about this movie that you don\\'t come across often. Positive Too positive and full of energy ))) First ever movie which made me to write a review. This is a great movie for the younger generation to learn good work ethics, And the older generation to understand the younger generation!! The film digs you in from the very start. This movie really can relate to everyone in every gender. When the movie was over, it left something sweet in my heart. Even if you aren\\'t all that ecstatic about the business world, ism sure you will love the movie for all of its other qualities. The movie opens with a tilt, down from the trees into a park where we first meet the one of the main characters. There is no doubt in my mind that I will be watching this movie again sometime in the near future.',\n",
       " 'review_cluster_10': 'I think the whole world should have a Senior Intern because it helps them to adapt with the new norms. I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this movie; a retired businessman and widower (De Niro) decides to apply as an intern for a successful online fashion start-up company founded by ambitious Jules often (Hathaway Hathaway) -- they are generations apart but they find a way to successfully work and support each other. So, he answers an ad for an outreach program for senior interns (senior as in age) to help out at \\'About to Fit\\', a successful internet company that specializes in woman\\'s clothing. Ben gets the unenviable task of being the intern to the company\\'s CEO, a supposedly tough-as-nails career woman named Jules often (Hathaway). He wants to get back out and meet people with purpose, and enrolls in a senior intern program at an internet startup. While searching for something meaningful to do with his time, he stumbles across an advertisement for an senior internship program. He decides to apply as an intern at a company called About The Fit, a fast-growing business that sells fashionable clothing online. With The Intern, there is now some promising indication that his slump is over. desire shines in his portrayal of a retired gentleman from a bygone era who takes on the role of a rookie intern in a quest to inject his geezer life with some meaning. Ben is seated with the other interns, all of whom are recent college graduates. The Intern represents a comeback of sorts for actor Deniro, who shines as an older man looking for a way to live a meaningful life. It s a pattern I don t think we ve seen a lot of - a mentor who needs his up-and-coming apprentice. bends first job as a senior intern coming through a senior intern program is julep\\'s secretary. It turn out as a campaign to hire a mentor as old intern. As he struggles to keep himself occupied with, yoga, tax chi, mandarin and violin classes, and ignoring the advances of various senior ladies, he manages to land an internship to an overgrown start up that struggles to keep up with its own success. Not a bad rom-com, where (thankfully) De Niro is not the love interest - he\\'s a senior-citizen intern trying to fit into the new world (after 40 years in the phonebook business!) A retired successful business owner and widower lands an internship at a fashion website run by a young, career-driven woman. Interesting premise where the intern is a retired senior citizen. Senior internship program of an commerce startup founded by a young female already set the scene up for the drama and conflicts. \"The Internal\" is no exception: the story of a 70-year-old widowed man (a great Robert De Niro) who ends up becoming a practitioner of an internet clothing company is definitely appealing. bends the very senior intern to Hathawaya Hathaway Jules Ostin, a hustlin\\' just century sister doin\\' it for herself, her daughter & her stay at home husband. He applies to a be a senior intern at an online fashion retailer and gets the position. He comes across an opportunity to be an intern in a senior citizens\\' internship program for a startup fashion online company. Funny, interesting, well-made film about a retiree who wants to get back into the work world and finds an internship assisting an entrepreneur who\\'s overworked. The Intern is about Deniro diner trying to find a purpose in life after retirement. He enters an internship program at Hathawaya Hathaway company, where he becomes someone to lean on. The founding boss of an internet clothing company looks for a coo to take over to give domestic life some relief & is saved by a retired executive senior intern. Loved seeing the friendship blossom between the senior intern and young ceo. The Intern \"Experience never gets old\" and his name is Deniro Following a widower as he tries to keep himself busy on a daily basis, not matter what it is, Ben (De Niro) is hired as a senior personal-intern to Jules (Hathaway) at an online fashion website. Ben applies for an internship as a senior citizen for an online fashion retailer. Directed by Nancy Meyers, the film follows a retiree who applies for a senior internship with an internet upstart company and gets partnered with the company\\'s overworked and controlling president. 70-year-old widower Ben (Robert De Niro) becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway) in a surprisingly quite lovely. Her company, also full of hipsters with less acumen put out an advert for a \\'senior-intern\\' or rather an old person for the office work to make them feel useful. He joins an online fashion startup founded and run by Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway) as a senior intern and quickly make friends with his old school charm and his caring nature. Looking to fill the void in his life, he applies and gets into an internship program for an upstart online fashion company run by a young entrepreneur (Hathawaye Hathaway). Deniro is the eponymous intern who has nothing better to do than work in a senior program after being a company man much of his life. A novel twist on the normal post graduate intern ship within high rise companies. After seeing an advert for an intern ship for the over it\\'s he took the plunge and got the job. De site\\'s kritische consensus luidt: \"The Intern doet net genoeg met haar tijdige premisse, maar profiteert van de onorthodoxe chemie van haar getalenteerde afleidingen.\" He applied an intern for Hathaway company not just because he wanted to do something but he wanted to be needed. This is a very endearing, gentle and easily watchable escapade that sees an ageing Deniro being given an internship with an commerce fashion company and becoming surprisingly useful at bestowing his considerable knowledge to his new colleagues. Hathaway who played the clueless intern in the Devil Wears prana now plays a coo of her own company. The intern this time, is the 70 year old sober Dinero. A good role-reversal comedy in which De Niro plays a retired businessman who gets a jot as an intern at Hathawaye Hathaway\\'s character\\'s Internet fashion company. Naturally, he is picked as her personal intern, and following her predictable rejection of his offers to actually do something, he gradually becomes her mentor and sounding board. Deniro is the wise old gentleman participating in a new senior intern program at her company. This also began with bends journey, and would have benefitted from a reflection of where his character is now as a result of this internship. THE INTERN starts off as retired but bored Robert De Niro joins a vibrant web start up headed by the workaholic Hathawaye Hathaway. The intern in this case is desire that has got tired of his retirement. He sees a post about an internship and have to struggle to get in to the bosses good grace. Then she looks at the 3 guys that are also interns as well as Ben (Di Niro) and they are dressed in casual rather sloppy clothes and he is wearing a suit and tie. In the The Intern, we are able to see him play someone new. He applies for a senior intern position at an commerce fashion company, About the Fit. Met de chemistry van Robert de Niro en Hathawaye Hathaway kan The Intern bijna net misgaan, touch heeft de film last van been the lange speelduur vol onnodige zijplotjes en overbodige karakters. a promising intern, let down by a run-of-the-mill corporation He plays a retired guy who accepts a new job as an intern. Seems like throwing a message that interns should do things even private even not paid tho.. every startup could use an intern like Deniro. Telling the story of a retired man who joins a senior internship program in an internet clothing company, with the aim of making sense of his life again. That\\'s pretty much the highlight of Nancy Meyers The Intern, a fluffy dreamed about a 70-year-old widower working for Hathawaye Hathaway as an intern. So when he come across a program that seniors would become interns from a fashion company, he wants to apply for it, got the job, and now work as an intern for the coo of About the Fit. Old interns...hmmm haven\\'t heard of this, but I guess it\\'s happening. A very charming movie about a 70yr old retired guy who takes an internship at a new online business.

One surprise is that the old intern \\'Ben\\' (De Niro) is not incompetent. Then again, an online vendor that sells clothing to \"housewives\" might attract mainly white college educated employees. Hathaway owns an internet company and hires a retired intern in the guise of De Niro. Shot near the perky side of Brooklyn, New York and featuring an email heist referencing caricatures from Ocean\\'s Eleven, The Intern is a romcom without the \"rom\", a centerpiece sledgehammering facets of old age (you could also throw in older people\\'s spar with newer technology). The solution: He signs up for a community outreach program in which seniors intern for thirtysomething boss, Jules often (Hathaway). often owns a Internet fashion company, built from the ground up. The company decided to develop a \\'Senior Intern\\' who, over time, becomes like a father to her. A senior citizen takes an internship in an internet company, after losing his wife. With The Intern, however, we get a full drawn portrait of a still-vital retiree helping Jules through some crucial work and life changes.

Until one day he learns of a opportunity to become a senior Intern at a online fashion company, and he pounces at the opportunity. When walking the streets of his native Brooklyn, he sees a flyer for a senior intern program at a young, but burgeoning internet clothing company.

The intern has Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway) as the CEO of an internet business that became successful overnight, and they decide to create a program for older people to work as interns within the company. A rising company is looking for \"senior\" interns, that is, people who have had tons of experience who can be used as a kind of publicity stunt. He spots a flyer advertising internships for senior citizens. find (Rene Russo) is the company masseuse. So through a community outreach programmed which one of her company\\'s executives hatched, Ben finds his away into at as a senior intern after impressing some of the much younger employees with his warm sense of humour, his cheery candy demeanor and proving least likely among his competition to drop dead while on the job (yes, we mean this literally). My second job was also an intern position that paid nothing in exchange for experience. The Intern boasts it\\'s own account of a trainee who may be a few years older, but just as able bodied and ambitious as the next guy. Rather then sulk, he takes a new kind of intern program that recruits seniors.

And one day he signs up for an internship for the elderly at an online fashion company. The very busy and distracted Jules doesn\\'t remember even sanctioning a program for senior citizens and doesn\\'t want her new intern. He sees a FLYER advertising for \"senior interns.\" Anyway, Bobby sees the ad, is \"selected,\" and shows up with veteran actress celiac Weston, some elderly black man and, INEXPLICABLY, back Pearlman, who clearly is NOT a \"senior.\" These are the \"interns\" that are going to help out at Jules\\' business. Robert De Niro here is a recently widowed 70 year-old, bored with his life who applies for a senior internship post at an online fashion house run by its kindly, no make that saintly young founder Hathawaya Hathaway who gets to cycle around her own office, as you do. He answers an ad for an Intern for a start up company that sells woman\\'s clothes. When a senior intern program shows up he jumps at the opportunity and ends up working with his bitter boss (a sickly sweet Hathawaye Hathaway) she just happens to be younger than him. A depressed 70 year old widower becomes an intern?

There are at least four(4) parallel subplots going on: i) the retired widowed executive wishing to stay active, ii) a startup growing too fast for its founders to cope with, facing the urge of installing an external CEO, iii) the romance the \"intern\" finds and iv) the price the founder of the start-up needs to pay in the personal front with the husband cheating on her. Fortunately, he found a new spark as a \"Senior Intern\" in a completely opposite young adult internet firm. If bends finding of the notice for the senior citizen intern program is the inciting incident, the \"call to adventure\" occurs after Ben passes all the interviews at the firm and is hired to be one of four interns.

Can this new intern help relieve some of this stress? In a word...charming Like most of you, I did not make it to the movie theaters in September, 2015 to catch the Nancy Meyers \"fish-out-of-water\" comedy THE INTERN about a 70-ish man (Robert Deniro) who goes to work at an Internet Start-up company headed by a a driven Millennial (Hathawaye Hathaway). bends character grew through the opportunity he was afforded by becoming the intern. A widower and retiree named Ben (Robert De Niro) applies to be a senior intern at an online fashion business.

Still as the intern job in the film is related marketing \"fashion wear\" it should be no surprise that his position is unpaid given labor abuses in this field are the norm.

The best bits are the Interns interactions with his co- workers. With \\'The Intern\\' I can only assume he needs the money or is fulfilling some hidden contractual obligation.

We have a man, old and alone, having to do nothing basically, joining as an intern to just make himself busy. \"Intern\" stars Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old former executive at a now- defunct (of course!)

So he applies for a senior internship at this newfashioned fast rising web shop. When he spots an add for a senior citizen internship, applies to it and eventually gets the position, the two are teamed up. I do like the idea of \"senior internship program\" which is Ben got the job at the firm in this way. When he spots an ad for a \"Senior Internship,\" working for a successful internet start-up, he relishes the opportunity. The story line is great and makes one wonder why more retired people are NOT brought in as interns, or, as (paraphrased) one person said, \"who would you rather have as an intern...a seasoned retired executive or some kid who was recently playing beer pong in college?\" Handkerchief is need not only working in network Ben is a man who is retiring the work and start to work at the fashion company as intern. He is hired by rule who is coo at the company. When suddenly an opportunity arises allowing him to apply for an senior internship at an online fashion site.

Really, from jimmy convey to a retired widower restarting life as an intern. This is a movie about a retired widower coming back to work as an intern in a hip fashion house and the comedy that arises from his old-school low-tech been-there approach to life and the web-wise younger generation colleagues who think they know it all but really have a lot to learn. Turns out the senior intern has a history with the building. He plays the role of a person who has served many years and after his retirement from previous job ,he is bored to death and seeks to work for free as an Intern for a booming e commerce company. He is a seventy year old white man with years of experience running a company. He was sincere, steady, and strong in this role as an Intern providing life\\'s experience to a young startup mom. Ben, a 70-year old intern is a personal beck-and-call person to his 28-year old female boss. A 70-year old man, played by Robert De Niro bored of retirement, applies for an internship programme to have more and something new to do in life. Though he applied for the internship voluntarily, he ended up doing more work than the paid employees around - - thanks to his years of business knowledge, and his nature of wanting to be of use (he cleaned a messy table - without being asked - playing the typical role of an unpaid intern in real life!) Clearly, the internship has nothing much to give to him in return, except, of course, a female masseuse as a friend. However, the president of the company is surprised to see the elderly people who are not at all think of interns. I think it is strongly recommended that many interns of age finally have considerable value and organize fulfilling life .... . A widower is bored with retirement and gets a job as an intern at an online clothing supplier. An older man is appointed as an intern at a startup and finds he is needed more than he might think.

Great chemistry between the two main characters and cleaver concept of a storyline of a senior intern working for a young business founder. Seizing an opportunity to get back in the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway) - a true barnstormer of a creative personality obsessed with her success of her start up business.

To start with, this story is about the old widower Ben, who has tried everything in his life, but being an intern is a novel experience for him. It\\'s heartwarming and nice to see an elderly person get a new lease on life as an intern. Contemporary women Jules often has worked as an Intern over a year. First, the older non internet-savvy intern: really, would a \\'senior\\' be so ignorant (it was their generation that invented the internet) and how to join Facebook? The Life of an Executive Women Although Ben Whittaker (De Niro), the intern, is the central character of this movie, as a female manager and titled officer of a multi-billion international corporation, I easily identified with the Jules Ostin (Hathaway) the company founder. A 70 years old man got an internship in an online company.

Other times, students get internships as something to put on their college applications, giving them an edge over others. However, in the movie \"The Intern\" by Nancy Meyer, the new intern at the company is an 70 year old retired man. The coo of this company is a young woman, around age 23, who started the company herself. The new intern has his internship at an online fashion store company. Ben Whittaker, the intern, has no idea how to work a computer. Ben whittler is the 70 year old intern who knows nothing about computers. Ben whittler is a retired worker who knows nothing about this type of work, defying the stereotype that interns are college students looking for a job. The Intern is about Ben Whittaker, played by Robert De Niro, a retired, widowed, seventy-year-old who worked as an executive for DEX One. Ben finds himself bored while living an uneventful, retired life in Brooklyn, New York and after seeing a flyer, he applies and lands a senior intern role for an online fashion website. The difference in age of Ben and his Co-Interns gives him the opportunity to teach them with his knowledge and experience and they return the favor by teaching him all about Facebook and simple tasks like how to turn on his new work laptop. Ben later comes across a flyer that explains an intern position for senior citizens.',\n",
       " 'review_cluster_11': 'The intern\\' has chemistry-rich lead performances and a tenured auteur behind the camera. \"The Intern\" is a pleasant film, original and with very few flaws; you look at it with pleasure from the beginning to the end. \"The Intern\" has a slow and tiring narrative, the script barely moves and the ending is disappointing Jokes aside, \\'The Intern\\' is truly a heartfelt, cheerful and emotionally uplifting film powered by beautiful and nuanced performances by Rober De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. The best thing I can say about the Intern is that it doesn\\'t suck. I would\\'ve let it slide if \\'The Intern\\' wasn\\'t on for two hours - that\\'s too much cheese for me. ‘The Intern\\' is a MUST SEE. The Intern suffers from lack of ideas, their development and history itself. The intern is funny and heartwarming. Its a feel good movie and i am sure that everyone is going to wish for an intern from now😉 The Intern is like a stack of pancakes. The Intern isn\\'t bad exactly; it\\'s light, breezy but is of no real significance. For about the first hour of The Intern I was fairly bored. The Intern was written and directed by Nancy Meyers who specializes in cupcake-sweet confections like It\\'s Complicated and Something\\'s Got to Give and the Father of the Bride movies. The Intern has only faint echos of humanity. The intern doesn\\'t have much to say either that broadcasting is a Sunday afternoon movie you\\'d forget to see seen because it doesn\\'t have much to contribute, it\\'s not a bad tape but really doesn\\'t have much to highlight. The Intern was a refreshing change of pace for me, theatrically speaking. \"The Intern\" is not spectacular by any means. GREG: I thought this movie was too reminiscent of last year s The Interns starring since Vaughn and own Wilson. The Intern is a little more personal in that Ben takes on a more mentally role early in the film. And I think we see this pattern revisited here in The Intern. Another intern is a comic figure. Movie: Cast: Hero: GREG: I found The Intern to be an overly simplistic, melodramatic, under humored and pandering to the older generation. I can t muster more than 2 Reels out of 5 for The Intern. However, as like the impression given by the title \"intern\", in the beginning of this movie, an unusual intern gives the impression of enjoying an interesting intern, but it starts to escape from the topic more and more. Even though it is not an ordinary intern, it is what happen when trying to break through the point that if the company looks reality, there are many restrictions. It might be said that this movie is chiefly about interns on the company. But the problem with this movie, in my view, is that movies have become closer to mentor than intern. The view of the movie, which focused on interns, is narrowed the focus on the two people. It may be that the life of an intern is portrayed as an ambiguous point, and may have succeeded in finding intern like an angel in fairy tales. The Intern is a nice feel good film directed by Nancy Meyers staring Hathaway and Deniro. For most of its running time The Intern gets off to Deniro amiability and Hathaway high energy, but as the movie progresses to the end we are left with a bittersweet aftertaste. I didn\\'t expect much from the intern but I was surprised it\\'s a decent film. Despite Deniro\\'s and Hathawaya Hathaway great performances, \"The Intern\" misses a lot of opportunities to make its plot more interesting. With good performances from Hathaway and Deniro, as well as competent writing and direction from Nancy Meyers, The Intern is a perfect example of a 3 out of 4 star movie; it\\'s a surprisingly entertaining but uncomplicated film. Have you ever watched \"The Intern\"? \"The Intern\" is one of the best touching film. Old washup man pretends to be an intern... worse movie ever. This film is not going to be a masterpiece, but I see it as an entertaining film that you are inevitably going to have a good time in, even with a simple story, it offers heart and the connection between this coo and the much older intern is what really makes this film amazing and important. The Intern is without a shadow of doubt a 2015 film. 20 years ago, The Intern would not of been made. There\\'s an interesting twist a little after the heist which was definitely needed, because as good as The Intern is, it never played down a firm mission statement for either of the leads to accomplish by the end, and the twist gave some welcome drama to what I found to be a very enjoyable, sweet and likable film. Don\\'t think it would be another \\'The Internship\\' as I initially thought, but slightly it is and much better everyway. The Intern is funny, charming, and heartwarming. *** Average I am internally grateful that you are taking a few minutes out of your day to read my cheesy review of Writer-Director Nancy Meyers\\' comedy \"The Intern\". I admired how meters directed the first hour of the movie, but then it looked like \"The Intern\" ran out of steam during the second half with too many elongated scenes; and that is why I could not give \"The Intern\" a review promotion. \"The Intern\" was 2 hours long, it didn\\'t have to be. This intern could have done it\\'s job in a sheer 90 minutes, but it stayed for not-needed overtime; and for that I can\\'t highly recommend for you to hire \"The Intern\" into your movie watch company. When watching the previews I was reluctant to watch this film because I thought the only possible story line was the older intern would end up dying. The Intern teams up desire and Hathaway in a romantic comedy about a young boss of a fashion company that hires a 70 year old intern and how these two become best friends and confidants. The Intern was absolutely wonderful! I cHathawayot give enough positive feedback for \\'The Intern\\'. It\\'s a bit schmaltzy and long, but The Intern overcomes it\\'s faults with the chemistry of its two leads. The Intern was nothing like I expected it to be and that was a great thing. Usually these films are throwaways, but I make a prediction that \\'The Intern\\' will be film to rank alongside \\'Along Came Polly\\' and \\'Four Weddings\\' in years to come. The Intern\\' won\\'t give extreme belly laughs and is arguably overlong however it\\'s enjoyable enough to not be bothered by those elements. I wanted to like it and i managed that; however, it raised questions like the intern was from a different industry not a different planet; he was perfectly suited to take some of the burden off of her, ism not sure that ever came out. \"The Intern\" stars both of them respectively and say what you will about sappy plots like this, \"The Intern\" is a very, very good film about life in general. \"The Intern\" does benefit from an experience writer in this genre, which is why most of the film is so great. With all the right feel good moments, compelling character developing scenes, and the perfect amount of levity between young and old characters, \"The Intern\" is a far better movie than it should be and I highly recommend it. Yet despite some mixed messaging, The Intern is entertaining and fun. The rest of the dialogue consists of cliché after cliché, and I got bored after about 5 minutes after he starts his internship. http://hubpages.com/entertainment/A-different-kind-of-intern-for-a-new-generation Not your conventional feel good movie, really liked the premise and pacing and chemistry between AH and red and but ending w him as still intern and not a up or COO is ridiculous. The Intern is honestly nothing more than a lighthearted comedy. But hey, everybody approaches their twilight years differently, especially when it comes to a career in acting, and with The Intern, I can at the very least say he has a role that he is having a lot of fun with. The Intern is a very typical fish out of water story, and it is totally something that you can and probably should take your parents to. The Intern is light, and surprisingly, it\\'s not all that different from 2013\\'s The Internship. Good drama and cute story http://rendumukkallo.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-intern.html When I set out to watch The Intern I expected charm and some laughs but what I got instead was charm and soul. The intern. The Intern was a fabulous movie. The worlds best optimist The Intern does not need to reinvent the wheel, and succeeds in doing what it intended, a feel good comedy about an unlikely friendship. Where the Intern goes right is with its actors and characters. Despite a unique premise, \"The Intern\" can\\'t overcome its trite and contrived storytelling. However, clinches and the strive for a feel-good-film hold back the potential The Intern was building. The Intern is a usual comedy. Still, The Intern is enjoyable, and successfully brings a smile. -The Intern is een 2015 Amerikaanse komedie film geregisseerd, geproduceerd en geschreven door Nancy Meyers. ondanks fouten zoeken met \"luie scenarioschrijven\" en \"Meyers\\'s verwarde ideeën over krachtige vrouwen,\" Dargis prees Meyers voor \"de slimste keuze make ze in \"The Intern\": Meneer De Niro, haar breedste, meest waardevolle speler\" die \"bezit de film vanaf het moment dat hij zijn mond opent \" Hathaway\\'s roll werd afgespiegeld als \"minder van been personage en meer van been snel wandelen, snel sprekend-collectie van geslacht grieven.\" I recently watched the movie\" The Intern,\" and I think the movie is great. I highly recommend \"The Intern,\" to all of my friends and you guys and I found umm... Nancy Meyers is a director that could really show gentle and subtle of the character and the playbook she wrote. The Intern is a clean comedy movie that is actually fairly funny (rare thing these days) with a likeable cast. The Intern is a cute comedy with lovable lead performances from Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. The Intern concepts are witty and adventurous!! The Intern had me fully immersed in the movie with light hearted humor and relationships of emotional value! When the afore is prescribed, \"The Intern\" will suffice. Nancy dyers directs and writes her next film in the Intern. The intern has some charm at first, but gets repetitive and really does not use the situation to offer much character development. The Intern feels long, and is not one of dyer\\'s best. #interns it\\'d have to say that this movie pretty much copies the Internship in plot minus a lot of the laughs. The Intern: The latest film by director Nancy Meyers could have easy slipped into the realm of predictable, emotionally-manipulative schlock fest, were it not for the unlikely chemistry of its immensely likable stars, Hathawaye Hathaway and Robert Deniro, who, as an over stressed owner of an Internet startup and the senior intern looking for meaning in his golden years, will have you rooting for them all the way to its oh-so-sweet ending. With the people involved, The Intern is sweet and cute with not much else to offer out of its cast and generic plot. The Intern has never offered something new and struck to be very sentimental, but it does pay off with good chemistry and a charming cast. With a great cast and unique plot line Intern is a movie that you won\\'t be disappointed by but also won\\'t be one you\\'ll yearn to watch again. The Intern won\\'t redefine cinema, not that it\\'s meant to, but it\\'s a sweet and clever crowd-pleaser that works equally well as a comedy and also dramatically, mainly due to the pairing of Hathaway and De Niro. With some genuinely insightful dialogue, a number of truly funny bits of physical business, and small scenes allowing us to get know and like a half-dozen supporting players, The Intern grows us on from scene to scene, from moment to moment. The success of this film may ride entirely on the alchemy of these particular actors, but whatever is carrying it, The Intern gets there. With The Intern, meters has made another bright, contemporary america comedy with a lot on its mind - and works hard to make it look effortless. The Intern entertainingly fills that slot VERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. The Intern doesn\\'t do enough with its timely premise, but benefits from the unorthodox chemistry of its talented leads. The Intern avoids two major cliches. Writer and director Nancy Meyers continues to display her abilities in both roles with THE INTERN. As critic reviews will bring out, THE INTERN is not as nuanced as some would like it to be. Specifically, THE INTERN does not simply make fun of differences resulting from age gaps (although it does capitalize on some generational disconnects for several amusing moments), but reminisces and then proposes that some \"old ways\" of doing things may still be valuable. THE INTERN does not particularly break new artistic ground, but it is nonetheless fun, wise, and emotionally satisfying. It\\'s as if The Intern was written with him in mind. Pleasant enough film if somewhat predictable after the initial \"old-man-as-intern\" novelty has been sprung. While THE INTERN deals with a different slice of life as schemer\\'s summer comedy, we once again find the pattern of a woman living in what was traditionally a male role. THE INTERN will not get any awards or even nomination and will most likely not be remember in the Hathawayals of movie history. I watched \"The Intern\" on my flight home --- wow. The Intern is a interesting little comedy\\\\drama that centers on a retired man played by desire who interns for young coo Hathaway. The Intern (2015) is a drama/comedy film starring Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. The Intern (2015) brings good classy comedy to the table while taking you through the day to day of a 70 year old intern in the tech world. The Intern (2015) is enjoyable for all ages and didn\\'t come slam packed with innuendos and quick one liners like most of the films from the last decade. The Intern (2015) is a cute film. Funny, enjoyably charming and heartfelt, The Intern may unnecessarily stretch its running time but strongly benefits from the terrific chemistry and performances from Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Boring and pandering, The Intern - despite telling a story as languid and cloche as its protagonist - is all over the place. Going into this film I was not excepting much, but The Intern ended up being my favorite feel good comedy of the year. Simply put, there\\'s not enough substance or climax in The Intern to totally win the filmier over. The Intern is a funny, charming, riveting, and sweet dramedy and features a great performance and chemistry by Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. The Intern is op zijn best wHathawayer De niro en Hathaway samen the bewonderen zijn op het scherm. I had expectations for how the story would go and my only complaint is that it would have been good to see the results of all the advice he gave to the interns around the office while he was waiting for his email. Sometimes it needs to be real and warm, which is what The Intern is. The performances in The Intern are very good. The Intern is really funny, specifically a breaking scene that had me crying. Just back from \"The Intern.\" The Intern was a feel good movie, funny at times but boring at others. I had little to no expectations going into THE INTERN, but boy was I pleasantly surprised after leaving the theater. THE INTERN is a happy and incredibly enjoyable time at the movies. The Intern meets everything it proposes, is fresh and is very fun, something that is very appreciated and that lovers of the genre enjoyed. The Intern is probably Meyers\\' worst film but I still had an enjoyable time with it. This movie is the reversal; her a young boss with a much older employee, The Intern. The Intern was a refreshing piece of cinema that dealt with the realities of ageism (specifically in the workplace) in a humorous and charming way. Not only will I be purchasing The Intern when it is released, but it has earned the coveted title of \"A favorite movie\" of mine. would\\'ve been another Devil Wears Prada, but it went from focusing on the elderly intern, to delving into the female coo\\'s relationship... unnecessary! The Intern is a movie with a premise that hooked me from the first time I saw a trailer. \"THE INTERN\" is a heart warming tale of friendship and light comedy. Although I\\'m normally raving about some shoot-em-up, kick-butt action film or unbelievable property destruction movie each week, I really enjoyed \"The Intern.\" The Intern gets one thing seriously right: the casting of Robert Deniro. Funny, charming, and heartfelt, The Intern doesn\\'t fall into the typical conventions of its genre and provides a genuine story lead by two incredible actors that have a surprisingly natural and wonderful chemistry. So how come we went we had 3 groups to use within 5 days and only a few to pick from so we picked The Intern and are we ever glad we did. It may not explore all of its plot points completely, but thanks to Nancy Meyers\\' light dialogue, perfect cast, and and amusing premise, The Intern still comes off as thoroughly appealing. I saw \"The Intern\" last sundae at the csc Rolling Hills 20. The Intern is warm, bright, and lovable. Vraiment, The Intern best one folie surprise. The Intern is nothing short of wonderful. http://ppcorn.com/us/intern-film-review/ The intern is a confusing movie, both in its (and i hesitate to use this term for fear of shitstorm) gender politics, its slant on experience and the bizarre likability of its two leads. Because let\\'s not mince words, this is what the Intern is. So, yeah, the Intern is appealing and endearing, even if it misfires quite a bit. Thanks to the chemistry of the two superstars in The Intern, desire and Hathaway, The Intern is a likable movie. Any movie like this is going to have a problem if the run-time is over hours (The Intern is 2:01). Once this clumsy part to the story is past, The Intern really takes off. With an 80% audience score, which is excellent, it\\'d say The Intern is definitely worth a rent. The Intern is directed and written by Nancy Meyers, and it stars Deniro and Hathawaye Hathaway in a comedy film about Ben whittler (Deniro) who\\'s a senior and wants to apply for a job. But with all of that said, I clearly underestimate The Intern, and ism glad that I did. This is the premise for The Intern and it\\'s not a horrible one. Not to confuse with 2013 Fox\\'s The Internship, this similar type of drama without a ship behind feels more promising, funny but not ridiculous and thoughtful which one could have expected through its poster. The Intern is a movie about stereotypes. \"The Intern\" is a surefire hit for adults of all ages. Last night we went out with some friends to see, \"The Intern\". The Intern: A Perfectly Heartwarming film, and much much more! The Intern\\' is run-of-the-mill heartwarming drama about a woman who makes good with an idea, a laptop, and a chair. He is the perfect intern. I have to give \\'The Intern\\' an A-. I do like the Intern a lot because it brings another perspective on how a successful retired businessman ended up in trying new things as signing up for intern at a fashion website business. Enjoyed The Intern. This movie was good, on the same premise of The Internship which I liked better. The Intern is evidence that movies can comedies can be uplifting, entertaining and sophisticated without crude humor and corny moments. VIEWS ON FILM review by jess burgeon 2015\\'s The Intern (my latest review) is great. As directed by Nancy Meyers, \"Intern\" has one of her trademarks written all over it. When they\\'re on screen (together or separate), \"Intern\" is a real winner. Anyway, if you\\'ve recently watched The Internship (2013), you\\'ll somewhat be reminded of The Intern. The Intern thankfully, reverses this trend. The Intern is about fitting in with the times while maintaining a certain humbleness before those who have what is irreplaceable: life experience. The Intern is one of the best from come style movie that have seen in awhile, even though there isn\\'t much romance between our main characters other than a father daughter relationship. The Intern is a sweet comedy that benefits from it\\'s simple plot and likable performances. The Intern is directed by Nancy Meyers and stars the great Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. This is the first Nancy Meyers film I am seeing and I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the intern. The Intern is a sweet feel good comedy that starts off as a movie showcasing the differences in lifestyle,mHathawayerisms and characteristics between the current generation and the older generation before heading towards the more drama heavy side of things with De Niro guiding Hathawaye Hathaway in some of her life choices. Deniro interactions with some of the other younger interns are also hilarious and had the audience laughing out loud. My only issue with the intern is that there are some unnecessary scenes which don\\'t really add much to the movie and hamper the pace making it feel slightly long. The Intern is definitely worth watching when you are in the mood for something light hearted. Out of the long list of films I had plHathawayed to go and see, The Intern was nowhere close to being on that list, but when my girlfriend felt the need to tag along to the movies with me and adamantly suggested that we take a break from the norm and try one of \"her movies\", I went against my better judgment and begrudgingly agreed, little did I know she would choose a film that was finally watchable. The Intern\\' sometimes has a weak plot development or bad line of dialogue but the actors make this work. \"The Intern\" is a film starring Deniro who enters a senior citizen internship program to bring a new dynamic to Hathawaya Hathaway startup telecommunications firm. At first, very little but the film builds to a nice ending, but with a firm ambition to sell you The Intern 2 too. All in all, \"The Intern\" is a well acted, average movie that your grandmother will love. Too entertaining to warrant a senior skip day thanks to its leads, The Intern takes a softball approach to its promising premise but moviegoers can\\'t help but love the chemistry behind this office non-romance. What makes The Intern unique so far as this writer-director\\'s c goes, however, is the age of the female lead. Overly sentimental and turns into a huge mess by the end, but there is no denial that watching The Intern feels like a good time and a modernized from come that actually works. The Intern is like a fresh air after a lot of overwhelming films that accentuate actions, and visual effects. Though a bit generic and cliched, the Intern has good charm and good performances from it\\'s cast. Enjoyed It\\'s Complicated so my husband and I went to see the Intern. I really enjoyed \"The Intern,\" but have a quibble about its treatment of middle aged & senior women. \"The intern\" is a great motion picture that draws comparisons between contemporary society and society of the past. A satisfying drama/comedy about the relationships between the old and wise and the young and wide-eyed, \\'The Intern\\' delivers great performances, and a simple story to chew on. desirous relationship with some younger male interns (young enough to be his grandsons) is also very funny. The Intern is another bourgeous, conservative film from Nancy Myers. The Intern is both cute and refreshing. The Intern is a thoughtful, entertaining and well-written film. 3.5/5* or 7.5/10 Being a gentleman, having true class, women empowerment, how life doesn\\'t end after a certain age and how to deal with real life relationships are all things a film like The Intern deals with. The Intern is the definition of feel good cinema, I can guarantee you that throughout the film you will be smiling, and there so many instances the film is just so heart touching.But what really works for the film is the lead cast of Deniro who is only getting better with age, and Hathawaya Hathaway who is epitome of really beauty. The Intern is a movie made for a mature audience, and while the film has many laughs, the films undertone meanings are what really win your heart. I mean for me the film really didn\\'t have any negatives other than the place slackened a bit towards the end Overall The Intern is not a pathbreaking film, but the film truly lived up to its amazing trailer.Its nice to see a film deal with real life situations, in a beautiful, light mHathawayer and not be so serious and sad. +Hathawaye Hathaway glows in \"The Intern\" whether she is leading 200+ employees of a company she founded or getting drunk and throwing up into a dumpster or crying when she has been betrayed or any of the many emotions she experiences in this 2 hour movie. For a comedy \"The Intern\" is only mildly amusing with the funniest scene having nothing to do with advancing the plot but a \\'breaking and entering\\' mission, which was written, and directed, by Nancy Meyers who has had success with previous films dealing with whether a woman can \\'have it all\\'. \"The Intern\" is a pleasant movie but drags in spots and touches on subjects without following through such as Hathaway relationship with her mother. The Intern exudes charm at every turn and drags you in from the first few scenes. The Intern is absolutely one of my top movies of the year. What I got to say about \"The Intern\" is a good comedy movie from start to finish. \"I have to report that \"The Intern\" is a one laugh out loud movie that will have your body hurting just of the humor in this movie that is so funny that you don\\'t want to miss. The Intern is your standard romantic comedy, without the leads having the romance, which works because that would just be awkward, unless your high refer or donate Trump. Well, I was gonna say intern slash best friend. That\\'s the kind of movie you get when you sit down to enjoy \"The Intern\" (PG-13, 2:01). \"The Intern\" isn\\'t perfect, but is definitely worth having around. The Intern is a simple, predictable movie--an old gentleman who wants a life meets a young person who is lost, and they eventually sort things out with some tears on the side. The Guardian\\'s Jordan hodman writes that The Intern is a \"chain of predictable sequences shot in a flat mHathawayer.\" THIS IS THE INTERN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. Overall, it\\'ll just barely give THE INTERN a 6 out of 10. My husband & I enjoyed The Intern very much. The first is that at one point desire and some of the other interns commit a felony, with gateway\\'s knowledge and endorsement, in order to save her some embarrassment from her mother. As an intern in a senior program this cutesy movie is a good sundae afternoon diversion. The intern brings nothing new and is slightly overlong, but it\\'s a charming little treat for comedy fans, and is one of Deniro\\'s better late period movies in a while. Finally a movie of that director and writer Nancy Meyers don\\'t screw the final act, The Intern is easy one of her best movies, mature, well acted (the chemistry between Deniro e Hathaway is amazing), well directed and very funny, this comedy for adult deliver a good entertainment moments for the audience. If you\\'re looking for laughs, then you\\'ll enjoy \"The Intern.\" \"The Intern\" is a film where you can predict the ending, but the ride is worth it. \"The Intern\" does what many current movies fail at and that\\'s make you love the characters. \"The Intern\" after thoughts: Completely loved this film from start to end!!! reselling Reviews: The Intern - A enjoyable and unexpected \\'coming-of-age-again\\' film Is getting old a bad thing or can it be a blessing? http://russellingreveiws.blogspot.com.au/2015/09/the-intern-enjoyable-and-unexpected.html I saw The Intern in avant-premiere at the Ostend Movie Festival in Belgium. Although The Intern offers a few good laughs and both Deniro and Hathaway give good acting performances, this is not the good tragic comedy drama it could have been. The Intern resigns to a simple moral tale: in the movie the husband is the \\'bad guy\\' for having an affair and Hathaway the hero. In stead of using this situation to discuss the impact of having a demanding career on family life, The Intern ends up being a simple good-bad tale. Never the less The Intern offers nice and easy accessible entertainment in typical Hollywood fashion. The Intern is exactly what you would expect. A ladies-friendly and gentle comedy, The Intern is a predictable, unrealistic and overly sentimental delivery which hugely, if not mostly, relies on the presence of its two leading characters. As a whole, The Intern could have been a much better movie, given the record of Nancy Meyers (Something\\'s Gotta Give), but in the end the flaws in her overall approach towards the story is partially compensated by the actors and the feel good final feeling. We will definitely recommend The Intern to many others. THE INTERN Review The Intern is a comedy that everyone can enjoy. But in \\'The Intern\\' the comedy is equally captivating interesting as the more emotional sequences. The Intern\\' was among my favorite comedies that I have seen in the recent past. But here the performances and situations feel fresh with the new twists of the aged intern, family struggles, and contrasting lives. - A- Nancy Meyer comedy THE INTERN from Warner Bros. Pictures stars Robert De Niro, Hathawaye Hathaway, Rene Russo, madam DeVine, Nat Wolff, Anders Holm, Andrew RHathawayells, each Pearlman, & Christina Scherer and is out in theaters September 25th, 2015. \"The Intern\" is a timely reminder that each generation is valuable to other generations. Funny, smart and relevant, \"The Intern\" is a gentle nudge telling us not only can we work together, we also have more in common than we thought. B When walking into the Intern you should know that this movie won\\'t get scar buzz, but instead just know that\\'s it\\'s such a fun movie. The Intern follows this senior citizen that becomes an intern with his boss that\\'s younger than him and as the film goes instead of creating a sappy and awkward lover story, we get a brightly developed friendship between Hathaway and Deniro that makes this film funner than sappier. Also that the conclusion to The Intern starts to drag on when you start to wonder when the film is ever gonna end because it adds so much more content for the sake of making this film longer and just like any feel good comedy, In the end besides those flaws, The Intern won\\'t give you anything new but it\\'s the perfect family movie that will make everyone laugh, think about the film\\'s morals and get entertained by. Nothing in The Intern is absolutely terrible, it\\'s just a movie that you should go watch with a family and just have fun with it for what it is. Clever, witty and backed by a formidable cast, The Intern, however, is bogged down by cheap plot twists and a forgettable ending. The Intern its a Masterpiece. Sure this won\\'t change the movie business or uplift De Niro or Hathaway\\'s careers, but The Intern is a thoroughly entertaining comedy-drama from Nancy Meyers that was fun from beginning to end The supporting cast of his fellow interns are fantastic. The intern shines because of a great cast and I treating concept that is executed just right I was looking forward to watching The Intern but unfortunately this was a little average to me. The Intern is that sentimental comedy drama film that tries to have that heartwarming, feel good outlook as the characters are going through some career challenges. Completely pleasant from beginning to end, there\\'s nothing in The Intern that\\'s challenge or provoke you...but you know what? Other than some unnecessary segments and supporting cast, \\'The Intern\\' is fine. There\\'s not much to say about The Intern. Liked the whole Senior intern premise. The Intern enjoyed the Story. \"The Intern\" is a gentle and funny work-place comedy that works mostly because of the likable chemistry between Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. \"The Intern\" is a pleasant and charming comedy from Nancy Meyers. It is not great cinema but \"The Intern\" was sweet enough for me to recommend it. The intern was an average comedy but it wasn\\'t quite as good as it\\'d hoped for it to be. My review https://42lifeinbetween.wordpress.com/2015/09/27/the-intern-review/ The Intern is more than it seems, but it doesn\\'t know how to balance drama and comedy. So \\'The Intern\\' seemed promising. The Intern\\' didn\\'t quite live up to expectations, it could have done more with its timely premise and does have things resolved too easily (the cheating subplot in a nausea-inducing forgiveness/reconsideration speech) and characters written too neatly and cleanly (with Ben being very amiable and irresistibly likable if too perfect, Jules is the only one with any real arc). What makes \\'The Intern\\' work is the two leads and their chemistry together. Really admired what \\'The Intern\\' did in giving Jules an arc and it was interesting to begin with, apart from benefitting from more show and less tell at how good she was at her job and such, but halfway through became awkwardly indecisive. Surprisingly Intern-resting! Deniro and Hathaway chemistry is a sheer delight, but Nancy Meyers\\' distracted screenplay in the second hour undercuts an otherwise genuinely entertaining start As far as on screen pairings go, \\'The Intern\\' boasts probably one of the most interesting ones in recent memory. Yes, \\'The Intern\\' works best when it is a twohanded between its unlikely on screen pairing, and fizzles out especially in the last third once it decides to make three a crowd. Good premise, flawed execution The Intern is what I call a \"paint by the numbers\" film. The Intern: Exceeded my expectations So I had no interest in The Intern, at all. The Intern is undeniably a sweet movie and it has substance but sadly it also has a number of overwhelming flaws. The Intern is a cute, even likable story about how elders may know more then you think It seems that in todays working world, the intern is the new entry-level job. On the surface, The Intern sounds like the kind of movie that would be easy to cater to older audiences with it\\'s wholly positive attitude. Story wise, The Intern is nothing of a challenge; it\\'s your nice story about the misunderstanding of someone\\'s skills while making a friend. In short format, The Intern is a cute movie. The Intern shouldn\\'t have trouble finding an audience. The Intern is The Boss! A 2 hour long commercial The Intern is a perfect example of the soulless crap Hollywood dares to crank out. The Intern is also so Politically Correct it\\'s sickening. \"The Intern\" entertains like a seasoned professional. The \"Intern\" group of guys were funny too. \"The Intern\" is such a movie. A surprisingly nice movie... \"The Intern\" turned out to be a rather nice surprise of a movie, especially because it was a really good story, and it was helped along quite nicely with some impressive acting performances. What worked out in \"The Intern\" was the storyline and the absurdity of the situation. There was a great combination of comedy and storytelling in \"The Intern\", so writer and director Nancy Meyers really managed to create something memorable and unique here, proving her talent for telling an outstanding story with outstanding characters. \"The Intern\" is one of the better Deniro movies in a while, and if you are a fan of him then you should definitely check out \"The Intern\", if you haven\\'t already done so. I saw the trailer for \\'The Intern\\' sometime ago, advertised before \\'Spy (2015)\\'. I just saw THE INTERN yesterday, and it really wasn\\'t half bad. The thing that struck me was that THE INTERN and THE FAN share an identical plot. Whereas THE INTERN is meant to be funny but is never fall down laughing funny, except maybe in one scene where Deniro leads a crew of young guys to break into Hathawaya Hathaway mother\\'s house. It\\'s no easier to pinpoint all the excess baggage weighing down THE INTERN than it would be to body-sculpt the average film-goer packing on an extra 10 (or 50), but one might start with they boys\\' home break-in caper. The perfect movie The Intern .... The intern\\'s wisdom and practicality brings a calm and peace to the busy boss\\' life. ism frantically thinking of something, anything to say that\\'s positive or of significant note about \\'The Intern\\' but nothing is coming to my mind. What I can say is that \\'The Intern\\' is as predictable as they come. I don\\'t want to sit here criticizing \\'The Intern\\'. I trust you to make up your own mind about whether seeing \\'The Intern\\' is the right thing to do. It just makes it all the more easy to decline this internship. Humorless drama In its television advertising The Intern is made out to be a comedy of some sort, perhaps a rom-com, maybe a dram-com, but anyway a light-hearted movie full of laughs. The Intern is just a lukewarm drama with a very few laughs. The Intern is, however, more of a comedy rather than romance. The Intern. \"The Intern\" will probably raise a few eyebrows out there with its team of marriage trouble, but one has to remember it\\'s a comedy, and its message is that anything is possible if you try hard to reach for your dreams and always keep a positive attitude. I mean, there either are companies out there using the concept of senior interns, or this movie\\'s premise is completely original and I love originality. Just sitting here, thinking back, memorizing those lovely and touching moments that fill The Intern. While I also loved the entire movie, bends genuine senior intern stole my heart as he did for all the other character that rightfully flocked to him. You\\'re never to old to intern! \"The Intern\" doesn\\'t solve any \"senior/retirement\" moments, but it does remind one life isn\\'t over until it\\'s over. De Niro-Hathaway chemistry warms the heart The Intern managed to garner only a 51 score on Metacritic. The Intern might have some moments of silliness, but it still touches the heart. The Intern is a comedy-drama film directed by Nancy Meyers. Not the best intern! I am internally grateful that you are taking a few minutes out of your day to read my cheesy review of Writer-Director Nancy Meyers\\' comedy \"The Intern\". The husband/boyfriend (don\\'t remember if they were married or not...) is a terrible person at the beginning and was just exactly the same at the end, the little girl \"struggle\" to not see enough of her mom went absolutely nowhere, neither how the younger interns dealt with their lives... The Intern is an outstanding film. The Intern is a must watch for everyone who enjoys feelgood movies. Fun Workplace Story Turning from fun to heartfelt, The Intern does a lot of things right in this drama-comedy. Add The Intern to your list of \"must-watch\" movies because this delightful comedy beats all expectations. The Intern, however, is hilarious while remaining sophisticated. Nancy Meyers \\'The Intern\\' is A Delight! I haven\\'t enjoyed a film off late as much as I did while watching \\'The Intern\\'. No one does lighthearted films better than meters & \\'The Intern\\' finds her at her finest. On the whole, \\'The Intern\\' is must watch. Nancy Meyers newest film, The Intern, starring Hathawaya Hathaway, Deniro, and rent runs is very entertaining and well made. The Intern is just a good old fashioned feel good heart warming fun movie that I think anyone could and would enjoy! Credit can be given to this film for its truly funny bits, but The Intern is ultimately bogged down by two inconveniences: a seriously crappy storyline & amateur screenplay. Screenplay Needed an Intern. The Intern (2015): Dir: Nancy Meyers / Cast: Robert De Niro, Hathawaye Hathaway, Rene Russo, Anders Holm, Adam DeVine: Absolutely boring comedy about relating to those least likely. \"The Intern\" (2015) is probably one of the cheesiest movies you will in many moons. Overall, \"The Intern\" is not a straightforward comedy as you might thing from seeing the poster or reading synopsis. Did Deniro intern \"The Intern\"? \"The Intern\" (2015) written and directed by Nancy Meyers I thought was a much weaker film than some of her excellent earlier work such as \"Something\\'s Gotta Give\" and \"It\\'s Complicated\". back Pearlman, as another intern, was off-beat but entertaining. Cute Doesn\\'t Cut It Overall, and a lot of people have said this, The Intern is cute. While The Intern does have some touching moments and a few cute jokes about the novelty of the situation, it comes incredibly short as it feels like a bunch of ideas are being pulled together and held in place by Deniro and Hathaway. never too old to learn new ways I like Nancy Meyers directing style ( the Holiday, Something\\'s Gotta Give).The cast of the Intern is a good ensemble of Robert De Niro, Hathawaya Hathaway and rent Russo. The intern turned out to be a great movie to sit though. Great going even in 70\\'s anear Says: Read somewhere that Deepika padrone is going to produce remake of INTERN , with Late Rishi kaput ,but after his death recently Hathawayounced Mr. backchat in the lead . The supporting cast, particularly the other interns, were excellent. This time I\\'ll be focusing on the latest Comedy entitled the Intern starring Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. The story of the Intern is a simple tale about two lost people in need of something to help get their lives back on track. Despite the familiar plot dynamic, The Intern somehow stands out from the mire of comedies that currently flood the market. But while the story is not the most unique, or exciting for that matter, The Intern does provide a handful of life lessons wrapped in a heart string tugging package. Speaking of laughs, the Intern\\'s comedy was a nice break from the overacted and ridiculously stupid stunts many comedies take these days. The Intern is not the most unique movie to grace the theaters, and it feels very much like a typical Nancy Meyers work. For quality acting and a fun movie, The Intern is worth a trip to the theater, despite it\\'s lacking of special effects. My scores for the Intern are: Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0 The Intern: A Delightful and Heartwarming Film That Hits All the Right Notes \"The Intern\" is an absolute gem of a movie that effortlessly combines entertainment, laughter, and a heartwarming story. What sets \"The Intern\" apart is its ability to tackle important themes with a light touch. In addition to its strong performances and thought-provoking themes, \"The Intern\" boasts impeccable production design and a delightful soundtrack that complements the story perfectly. Ultimately, \"The Intern\" is a feelgood movie that leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. With its stellar performances, engaging storytelling, and uplifting message, \"The Intern\" is a must-watch for anyone seeking an entertaining and genuinely good-hearted film experience. Starting over The Intern is an easy going, genial film. After such an illustrious career leading some of the greatest movies of all time, he decided it\\'s time to play an Intern for an Internet startup company in a movie with no meaning whatsoever? There could have been more about the other senior interns for something inside from comic relief, but otherwise a very watchable movie. \"The Intern\" is something of a generational back- flip on \"The Devil Wears Prada\". All of this makes \"The Intern\" a bland movie. \"The Intern\" has it\\'s finger on the pulse of young and old, but the heartbeat is the thing it fails to detect. If you want a movie that so light on it\\'s feet, then The Intern is that movie for you. \"The Intern\" is proof of this, a film that has many good messages, but is written with so much cheese and fluff that it would have fit better on The Hallmark ChHathawayel than as a major studio picture. Nancy Meyers\\'s \"The Intern\" ranks up alongside Noah Baumbach\\'s \"While We\\'re Young\" for one of the year\\'s strongest comedy-dramas, and it\\'s interesting to note how both films pose telling insights as they portray the post-World War II/baby boomer crowd clashing with the millennial generation. \"The Intern\" is a pleasant surprise for a drama, as many dramas boasting big actors fail to impress and audiences are left with the optimism that independent films will pick up their slack. Amusing but not hilarious; tries to be relevant, but unfocused \"The Intern\" is amusing, but seldom funny; pleasant, but seldom engaging; thoughtful, but not cathartic. Great Movie, a relaxing watch 5 October 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Intern. Pleasant The Intern is like a mild salsa: filling, healthy and satisfying without a whole lot of flavor or fear of heartburn. The Intern isn\\'t much different in spirit, yet somehow it works. Much like last month\\'s pop hit, The Intern\\'s inoffensive brand of entertainment will fall right off your brain when you leave, yet be catchy and familiar enough to divert you during its runtime. The concept is really nice, unlike the previous intern movies this is put in the best way with a refreshing breath by the writers. the movie is saved by the odd comedy mostly --the other interns. VIEWS ON FILM review of The Intern 2015\\'s The Intern (my latest review) is great. There\\'s actually nothing on the screen I hadn\\'t fully grasped the meaning of the word \"agony\" until I went to the cinema last night and watched \"The Intern\". What\\'s amazing about \"The Intern\" is that there is not one single event unfolding on the screen that would provoke a reaction in the viewer. The bottom line of \"The Intern\" is you should keep working like crazy and eat junk food, as long as you cycle in your own office, have a massive house in the heart of brooklet and make millions with the company you created. That\\'s exactly the problem with \"The Intern\". You wont regret it The Intern - will go down as one of the nicest movies ever made. \"The Intern\" has such a sweet story! Breath of Fresh Air The Intern is a really refreshing film. But The Intern feels different than anything I have seen this year. It has a senior intern for starters, but the mixture of heart and humor that The Intern carries is something special. It\\'s a little long but Nancy Meyers does a great job in her wheelhouse, which is making feel good movies, and The Intern is most definitely one. The Intern is one of the more surprising films this year. \"The Intern\" is one of those rare, recent movies for adults where nothing horrible happens. \"The Intern\" really is a feel good movie. If you are ever having a lousy day and you want to watch something that will give you a smile and make you feel good about humanity, please consider \"The Intern.\" The intern\\'s wisdom and support is very helpful and brings peace of mind to the constantly troubled boss. The plot of the \\'The Intern\\' is exciting and funny, it contains both wonderful jokes and heartbreaking moments associated with the experiences of the main characters; the acting and the director\\'s work are also great. That\\'s what meters has done with \"The Intern.\" As pathetic as \"The Intern\" comes across in the context of things that actually matter in the world, meters (\"The Holiday,\" \"What Women Want,\" \"Something\\'s Gotta Give\") proves masterful yet again at giving middle-aged rom-com escapist moviegoers a story they can lap up like hot chicken soup for two hours. What little \"The Intern\" has (for two whole hours!) Ageist, tired movie The Intern (I) (2015) was written and directed by Nancy Meyers. The Intern has a so-so IMDB rating of 7.1. It\\'s not a rom-com and it doesn\\'t have melisma McCarthy in the lead role, could The Intern be a positive change for modern cinematic comedy? The Intern is not reliant on excessive foul language or flatulent jokes to make the crowd laugh. Meyer manages to spin the central relationship as mentor/intern into something refreshing for a modern comedy. Internships are meant to provide new experiences and insights for people. The Intern met this brief and in the process provided a few laughs, so that we do not take this life too seriously. A surprisingly good film The Intern didn\\'t seem to stay in cinemas that long, so I had my doubts when I picked up a copy of it cheap on DVD. There are a couple of scenes that could have been cut (the email to the mother and following bar scene in particular) but on the whole I enjoyed \\'The Intern\\' and would recommend it to anyone looking for a different type of film. The Intern is no different. The Intern is all a mere figment of Nancy Meyers imagination. Based on the script of \"Intern,\" it would have been easy for him to recycle a number of characters from earlier films, turning on cruise-control for his performance. But he never dials in a single moment in this full-bodied interpretation of his character of the intern. The Intern is probably the safest film to be released this century. The worst part--and the reason I had to write this review--was that \"The Internship\" was more entertaining EVEN THOUGH this movie had better first-rate actors. It all comes down to one simple observation: \"The Intern\" doesn\\'t have much of a plot, but it\\'s got a heart, and that might be enough. There\\'s something I really liked in \"The Intern\" is that in a film that has all the reasons in the world to play the feminist card, you have a young successful woman who displays nervousness, lack of self-esteem, and emotional vulnerability, and it takes a man who belongs to the ancient generation to reassure her. And this self-esteem, this capability to work your way through success is well received by the other interns. I really enjoyed this melodramatic, stereotype-rich, rose-water sprinkled feel-good movie which is \\'The Intern\\', directed by Nancy Meyers, and bringing to screen the improbable pair of actors composed of Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. The Intern\\' will be criticized by many for taking life too easy, but if you are a fan of feelgood movies, or you just are in the mood of seeing one you would certainly like to watch it. The Intern (2015) : Brief Review -\\n\\nWhen a young-age success hires an experienced intern, only to learn the basic Jules of the office called \"life\". The Intern is a sweet little film with a sweet little thought and a sweet little process, but it takes a little longer than that little to make sure that you understand that little thought behind it. I just watch them once and then forget them in a day or two, and I guess that\\'s what\\'s gonna happen with The Intern too. A feelgood Film \"The Intern\" is not a romance. \"The Intern\" is and it offers the bonus of gently guiding the viewer toward real issues that everyone deals with. THE INTERN\\': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\\n\\nRobert Deniro costars in yet another Hollywood comedy flick; this one was written and directed by Nancy Meyers. Nice story... \"The Intern\" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch a seventy-year-old man becoming an intern on an online fashion site. To sum up, I have to say that \"The Intern\" is a nice movie to spend your time with and I am sure that you will have a great time watching it. The Intern is directed by Nancy Meyers, stars Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. The Intern appears like a generation gap fable or just century outlook on age and gender. Overall, The Intern is a light hearted and fluffy movie. Directed and written by Nancy Meyers, The Intern offers up an entertaining and finely balanced movie about growing older, about females balancing business and personal responsibilities at home, and about close relationships in general. The Intern is hard to rate because it\\'s much more reflective of life than the dramatic stylish script the audience and critics have often come to expect. What\\'s remarkable is that The Intern reflects one of the few movies that doesn\\'t focus on a romance plot and instead uses another relational theme as the movie\\'s core and still is able to captivate and move the audience, a rare and difficult accomplishment in itself. Better than expected The Intern is a relatively small minded comedy drama starring Robert Deniro and Hathawaye Hathaway. The Intern is good due to the cast of its lead and their chemistry throughout. Overall, the Intern is a solid comedy if you are into these type of films. Should Not Be Listed As \\'Comedy\\' I was led to believe \\'The Intern\\' was a comedy film. In \\'The Intern\\' she brings a charm and levelness to the character that thoroughly impressed me and confirms that she is a very fine actress and should be kept an eye on in the future. The Intern touches on several great subjects like old-age dating, stress, relationships and forgiveness. The Intern immediately feels a bit weird and corny, mostly because of an old man as an intern, but at the same time that\\'s what makes it feel new and fresh. The interesting thing about The Intern is that we follow the story through the eyes of Deniro\\'s character as he sees it in the film. With its two hours runtime, The Intern feels too long for its genre and format. The Intern is still an enjoyable film and like I said before, it deals with an interesting topic. Amazing movie The Intern is a comedy film, released on 2015. No Chick Flick or Romantic Movie but Cute Still It shows another side of the Intern. It\\'s also very different from the \"The Internship\" starring own Wilson and since Vaughan, which also dealt with the generation gap in a similar environment. Although \"The Intern\" has something to say about women and power, it\\'s not rammed home – all the points are gently massaged into the story. THE INTERN is now streaming on NETFLIX and AMAZON PRIME, if you are looking for a...I\\'ll say it one more time...charming...way to spend an evening - look no further than here. A refreshing dreamed I viewed Nancy Meyers\\' The Intern last year. I don\\'t want you to think that I think desire carried the film, but, the film was called \"The Intern\". I went to watch \"The Intern\" with some reluctance, I admit. Genuinely a \"Chick Flick\" in the worst sense of that expression \"The Intern\" is an exemplar of the concept of the \"chick flick\". The Intern is this kind of flick. But, in the end, The Intern is \"safe\" viewing fare, and at-worst an apologetic for the long-debunked myth of the Happy, Self-Respecting Intern. Interns (and Temps, and... and... and...) are largely being ripped off: Don\\'t forget that as you watch the flick. Even in light of Tarantino\\'s admission that he watches Kate Hudson flicks on flights, I think it\\'s safe to say that he\\'d... well, not exactly *despise* The Intern, but would certainly see it as not having enough of a redemption payload to redeem the time spent watching something so contrary to the time-honored film narrative esthetics that molded his own career. Great movie The Intern was one of the best comedy/romance movies have ever watched. Guys watch The Intern, it\\'s the perfect family movie.

Fun uplifting cross-generational film As a 60 year old guy, I related very well to The Intern. The Intern should leave you smiling and hopeful. The Intern isn\\'t perfect; some parts of it were abandoned without conclusions and nicely tied bows, while others were a bit out of balance with the message this film was trying to bring across, but ultimately at its heart, The Intern beats strong enough to incite warm and stirring emotion.

Unfortunately, we can\\'t reverse time, so now face the threat of his place being lost by an appearance in \\'The Intern\\'. The Intern The Intern is nice movie have ever seen. I can read the fact by watching The Intern. Being a gentleman, having true class, women empowerment, how life doesn\\'t end after a certain age and how to deal with real life relationships are all things a film like The Intern deals with. I mean for me the film really didn\\'t have any negatives other than the place slackened a bit towards the end\\n\\nOverall The Intern is not a pathbreaking film, but the film truly lived up to its amazing trailer.Its nice to see a film deal with real life situations, in a beautiful, light mHathawayer and not be so serious and sad. a heartwarming and wonderful movie Exactly the kind of warm and fizzy comedy one might expect from Nancy Meyers, The Intern is a low-key, enjoyable piece of work with a likable cast. The Intern is lightweight and enjoyable. It may not necessarily stand-out, but The Intern makes for a pleasing experience. the Intern\\'s universe, everyone is a kind, caring, lovely, wise, good willing, hard working, great person, moral compass, with a permanent smile on higher face. Of course a movie like \"The intern\" does not do justice to such an amazing actor, but still, it\\'s enough to show that when he wants, ha can also play a role that would considered easy and make it look dead easy.

The Intern Review The Intern is a film written and directed by Nancy Meyers. Verdict: I had a great time with The Intern. I thought the movie \"The Intern\" (hereafter \"Intern\") would fall into that condescending mold. \"Intern\"\\'s \"surprise\" answer is \"Of course he can\". This is where \"Intern\"\\'s title becomes (obviously) ironic. \"Intern\" is a gentle, calm, rather emotional, but life-affirming generational movie that re- assures us that older peoples\\' experience and wisdom never go out of style and, if presented non-judgmentally, can help younger people make informed choices on how to live a happy, balanced life. Yet, for 52-year-old me, I especially appreciated \"Intern\"s high regard for older people as personified by movie legend Robert De Niro. Uplifting, entertaining and sophisticated The Intern is evidence that movies can comedies can be uplifting, entertaining and sophisticated without crude humor and corny moments. But also the romance between intern Ben and company masseuse find and the sexual attraction they feel for each other is missing depth, edginess and perhaps some heartfelt comedic realness. The non sexual tension between young boss and old intern version, like it is now, could have worked but also then the whole script and all the dialogues would have needed to be completely rewritten. Another actress and probably another actor should have been hired: more comedy for the young boss and then Ben the intern should have been more of a dandyesque character who had seen the world. Intern is a caliber production that engages us and earns at least enough loyalty to keep our bums on seats for 120 minutes. Interesting that the lack of violence, extremity and bangs and crashes in general in The Intern is problematic for them while at the same time they don\\'t cope with a little play around story structure. Taste of old and new \"The Intern\" is a great \"feel-good\" movie filled with comedy, a laid- back plot, emotional heart-pulling moments, and it was an overall fun film. A wonderfully crafted film that shows that age is just a number, you\\'re never too old to go to work, and I personally think the senior intern program is actually a novel idea (don\\'t speak too loud it\\'ll give our current government ideas!) \"the intern\" The name is perfect for the film.and also who comes and goes in our lives..and also i think film has perfect ending is well....there is so much ce to my mind to write this review.but i think it is better to don\\'t write anything apart from that.

The Intern fails on its \\'experience never gets old\\' tailing\\n\\nThe movie, with \"Experience never gets old\" plastered in huge bold capital letters on the posters - forgets the story line some 10 minutes into the movie.

Female president, it is really difficult to work with a family life and a company together, but here the mentor interns penetrate the place, feel pain and joy and felt in a heartfelt, gradually the female president seeking stability Well ... and I think that the company\\'s employees and interns interact with each other, making it a fun and pleasant way to make life feel vibrant.

An interesting and cute movie for relaxation and positive emotions \"The Intern\" is an interesting and cute comedy movie. Finally, it should be taken into account the movie, in pursuit of a happy ideal world of equality, skips an important, in my opinion, detail - it practically does not show how \"the intern\" misses his wife. \"The Intern\" teaches us a lot: about good affairs with people, positive attitude to yourself, fairness, honesty, openness and full house of other things that we should never forget in our lives. Added to this is the thread of the tightening relationship between the main characters (between the intern and the boss). Great and inspiring film Film \"The Intern\" is a great example of strong and impressive humans\\' lives regardless of age and gender. A simple yet beautiful story about an old intern - not something that is normally thought! The new girlfriend for the Intern: the featured mob reviewer sees the company masseuse find as needing Ben, the intern. It is entirely sufficient to be an intern. A Charm that falls short The Intern had been on my list for a while. The Intern tried to fit the category of an authentic, uplifting, movie but never trusted its audience to carry it to that destination.

Even i wanted to become friends with the intern in the end and i only 29.

He has been seen in many movies but I have to say that his role in The Intern was very fitting. Looking back over some of the movies highlights I found that the movie The Internship is very similar in many ways. They both have interns that are considered \"old\", the use of technology is very big in both, and both movies came out in very similar eras.

       " 'review_cluster_12': 'It\\'s funny and sad, suspenseful and action packed. It has both the comedy and drama as well as a really sweet story. I have zero clue why anyone would rated this under 5 stars for a comedy/drama. Robert De Niro has now found home in these comedies in which he can express a more amusing side of himself, long overwhelmed by great dramatic performances. A good hearted drama comedy that entertains without becoming overly sentimental. The dialogues are quirky and witty. Entertaining, funny and sometimes touching plot. Actually pretty funny and heart warming They contain a germ of human interest wrapped up in a gimmicky script that is fit for a bad television sitcom. The exception is a great comedy she made 30 years ago called Irreconcilable Differences, about a kid who divorces her squabbling parents. One of the best comedy-drama films I have ever seen. The dialogue is hilarious. As a Comedy and Drama Film, This one is pretty good! But it\\'s listed as a comedy and I must say the laughs were good but sparse. But if your looking for a comedy I would give it only 1 star. Original mostly clean comedy Funny enough, and not too many expected things happens. thanks sky comedy for screening it. The script is well written and full of laughs. Not hilarious, but some fun and funny moments, especially with device & Pearlman. The producers may have tried to make this appeal to a wide audience, but it\\'s really geared towards people over 60. the jokes are stale, the characters are across the board stock, and the acting is either too much or too little. It might get some laughs out of the audience too, albeit cheap laughs. Sweet comedy. A decent heartwarming comedy by Nancy Meyers. I hesitate to call it a romantic comedy, as the two leads were never in danger of becoming lovers (although one would have to say they each came to value the other as more than colleagues) and there wasn\\'t a lot of laugh out loud moments, but the overall tone of the film left one feeling good about the people and their relationships. I liked it very much, light funny and happy. Dragged at points, but still very funny overall. it\\'s not the comedy that will make you laugh, it\\'s the comedy that will make you smile. Dynamic between characters was sweet, funny. I actually thought it\\'d be more of a comedy but the jokes it did have was the first half of the movie. Funny, and a pretty witty satire about the politics in today\\'s business office. Just the right mix of serious and humor. I was expecting a farcical half-baked comedy about how an old guy rejoins the work force and struggles with modern gadgets and work processes. It\\'s more a drama than a comedy, and is a good one too. This is not a comedy where you\\'re going to laugh openly loud, it is a comedy in the sense of the set of characters the film has. So if you enter it expecting a comedy, probably you won\\'t disappoint with what it delivers against your wish which is a heartwarming drama with some emotional moments. It\\'s very contemporary but a little deeper than a lot of these comedies with some interesting commentary on gender roles and a multidimensional female main character (even if she didn\\'t make it into the title, ahem). It tried just a little too hard to be likable and sort of missed the mark- the comical scenes weren\\'t really all that funny, the serious parts seemed insincere. Kind of a sappy buddy comedy of sorts. lighthearted comedy. The \"eye blinking\" thing was obviously an impromptu add-on during filming but Roberto De Nino does make it looks funny. You could identify with the story and it was funny. misogynistic, condescending and simply not funny. The comedy is clever and the themes in this movie are very topical in today\\'s world. Funny, emotional, and real Entertaining at first, but goes on far too long and falls apart near the end. nice diversion, some good laughs too. As far as basic comedies go, this is one of the better ones. it\\'ll give it props for letting madam device to use his comedic talent naturally in the scenes he\\'s given. It\\'s a light comedy, it\\'s not really funny at all. A heartwarming-style comedy drama. While there was certainly a least an average amount of laughter, I would consider this more of a drama (a nice one in fact). It\\'s basically a satisfying relaxing comedy with a catching plot. Some warm moments and comedic pleasures make this enough to watch but this induced laughs when it seemed to be trying to be sincere... it was so completely contrived. Actually pretty funny! Really good and very funny A cute comedy with good acting and some touching moments Not bad thought it was going to be more of a comedy. What starts out as a funny lighthearted, cute comedy has a more emotional tone to it later on in the film. Refreshing, lighthearted, and surprisingly funnier than I imagined it to be. A fun comedy that really works because of the chemistry of the two leads. Comedy and Drama well well balanced. Both have remarkable and fun chemistry which is both humorous and fun. Acting w as stiff and dialogue nauseating. It\\'s heart warming, funny, and smart all in one package. So cloche & contrived.... Not only did I not laugh, I didn\\'t even smirk. An easygoing fun drama that should be an example of what drama is supposed to be and a classic that is fun to watch from time to time. A good comedy quickly turned dark. Lots of laughs and ending was a true blessing. Comic yet sentimental! Very watchable light comedy that gets a bit too cloche towards the end. The trailer (which I never saw) probably cast it as a comedy, but it definitely is NOT a comedy. Goofy, broad comedy mixed with heavy personal drama, with some reasonably interesting things to say about gender roles and the role of the elderly in modern society. Alright but I had hoped it would be more comedy is And even when it\\'s not being directly funny it\\'s enjoyable to watch. The humor was extremely fun and it didn\\'t feel forced, it flowed well with the characters. This movie is basically Devil Wears Prada-lite, except the jokes aren\\'t as good. Enjoyable comedy, pace very easy to follow and very loveable characters. Predictable and cliche, yes, but fun nonetheless. A film that doesn\\'t try too hard to be funny and comes across better for it. Its a light hearted comedy and refreshing. No script no plot no humor no point no nothing. Is it a comedy, a drama? Unfortunately dyers feels this premise is a lot funnier than it actually is and relies on this too heavily. The supporting characters offer the majority of the comedy, and scenes such as breaking into a house to delete an email come off as forced. There was a lot of humor as well as heartfelt moments. But not a lot of laughs or emotionally compelling. It was simply a fun feel good comedy. I enjoyed it but it was very far from being a comedy. Amusing but grounded movie. Wonderfully pleasant comedy with thoughtful impact. It all fits together in a pleasant comedic dramatization. The \"old guy with a computer\" jokes that you\\'d expect, but not too much - they just let the character be the character after a while - so, was worth watching. this movie I loved ... to be a drama had very good comedy this combination of actors I love First 45 minutes were cute and funny, then it devolved into more serious topics, stopped being funny, and became very boring. Very likeable drama/comedy. Such a well-written, amusing story. Not the comedy I expected but it was still a decent movie Part comedy and part drama. Several parts were laugh out loud funny. Funny, witty and overall fun to sit down and watch with a loved one. It\\'s funny when it needs to be, and serious when the story requires as well, and it does both quite well, with good balance, and great acting from pretty much everyone involved. more heartwarming than funny but I enjoyed it. A poignant, character-based comedy about professional passion, the struggle to retain a healthy work-life balance, and how the unlikeliest of friendships can sometimes become the most meaningful. These days, it\\'s tough to find a comedy that even aspires to sophistication. While the premise of this comedy is very sweet with great comic potential, the writing doesn\\'t reach very far. - A few amusing scenarios, but nothing laugh-out-loud funny. It\\'s a classic you should introduce to them! This was a fun twist from the usual approach to comedies dealing with generational differences. That is it does exactly the opposite of what the recent \\'intern\\' comedy about googly did a few short months ago, and opts instead to tell an actual story about people. When you don\\'t get your mileage out of stuffed bears giving the finger, little dogs jumping out of windows, or people accidentally lighting their hair on fire, you find yourself in a situation where you actually have to act - because all the absurd distractions common to today\\'s comedies are absent. It doesn\\'t really get as much comedy as it should out of its strange premise, and it does occasionally begin to tire anchor start to get weird, but, thanks to the decent cast and their chemistry, as well as some actual sentiment towards the end, it manages to stay afloat. They\\'ll get all the jokes that fly over your head (read: many jokes). There were scenes that made us roar with laughter, and scenes that brought tears to our eyes. The idea is cute and the jokes write themselves. This was sort of a use awkward movie to see the funny but normal if free of a old man. Enjoyable modern office comedy-drama. It made me laugh (really embarrassingly hard at one point), uncomfortable (but not to the point of disturbed) and relate. I tip my hat to those who worked hard to make a very well produced classy comedy. Funny, but too predictable I died laughing when he gave the lady chasing him the \"I\\'m sorry\" look! Great very enjoyable I laughed sang amazing movie there was even applause at the end ð???ð???ð???ð???ð??¯ð???ð???ð???ð??? The movie kind of acknowledges that it\\'s cheesy and has very funny, deliberate over the top moments. It was a little long but it was funny and it kept us following all along. Some very laughable parts It took old school, and new school, and mixed them together for a very enjoyable comedic adventure. The movie makes fun of the generational differences we all have in a practical and funny way. I thought this was a comedy...it\\'s not but it was still a good movie. Just not my idea of a happy romantic comedy. Many laugh out loud relatable moments. It was funny, sweet and entertaining. Surprisingly one of the funniest movies of the year its funny, some truth, and some more funny. Did it want to be a comedy or a drama? It just had me laughing at one point, then sad, then laughing, then sad again. It has a little bit of comedy, drama, and a lot of heart. It was entertaining, funny, and with great performances. If you want some good laughs go see this movie. So many laugh out loud moments. It was funny and entertaining the whole time. Extremely entertaining & very funny Plenty of laughs, Loved it. What you\\'d expect - a nice feel good comedy that\\'s a nice way to pass the time. The new thing about director Nancy Meyers is one of the funniest and most adorable comedies of the year, all a pleasant surprise. It\\'s not terrible, and there were a couple of moments that made me chuckle. it was incredible very humorous I laughed I cried it moved me Bob But the jokes are consistent and the plot moves along briskly, and deals with just enough depth to lift it above many films of a similar style. Funny, interesting and overall very entertaining. awesome, best comedy have seen in a long time. Hilarious and not too heavy. This wasn\\'t the most exciting film I have ever seen, nor the funniest. There is substantial humor for the most part of the film until *semi-spoiler* it takes a more serious tone towards the second half of the film. It was funny and emotional without being trite and completely subverts expectations. Sure, it got good laughs in the theater but it seemed a little cheap and out of character for those involved. It\\'s funny and real and different. Plenty of laughs. It was heart-warming, funny & it sure shows how much society relies on technology with everything. The comedy poking fun at young teach employees made me laugh out loud several times. Has some smart comedy. We were both laughing so hard very early into the movie. Very funny but kind of left you hanging at the end. Not particularity funny or exciting, but not bad. Nobody laughed at all and I literally heard like five people in the theatre say \"This shut blows horse d*ck\". It made me laugh, cry, feel anger and sadness. It was entertaining, the relationship between the two of them was good though the hotel scene bordered on inappropriate. A comedy that does not challenge the viewer, does not impale or surprise, however it can touch a couple of specific viewers buttons. but I laughed too much to punish it Several funny moments. It is interesting, funny, not draggy. The supporting cast of ditzy hipsters is these for a couple of laughs including a rather cringeworthy \\'heist\\' scene that seemed tacked on. Sad in places, but funny and feel good mostly It\\'s really funny, and the drama moments work really well. In fact the first half of this movie has a few decent laughs in it. It\\'s enjoyable, Charming, well written and funny at certain scenes. Really funny throughout. I was thoroughly entertained and laughed a lot. It was a lovely feel good story with some funny parts. Some goofy laughs thrown in as well. Mildly funny in places but the random pardon joke made me cringe. I don\\'t know why it was listed as a comedy. Heartfelt comedy. A few good laughs, but poor timing/pacing despite cast of award-winners. Funny, lighthearted comedy with good acting. If only this had a few more laughs in it & was a little shorter... Old people, young people, startups, New York, business etc etc etc...You can find every single cloche in this 2 hours comedy. While the direction loses its focus occasionally, this is an enjoyable, easy-to-watch comedy with some gentle critique of aspects of modern society and good chemistry between its lead actors. Thought it would have been more of a comedy but it turned into a comedy with a love story and a little bit of a tear jerked at the end. The edit could have been crisper n sprinkled with more laughs in the script but overall the film does entertain. Enjoyable funny movie with a bit of preaching monologue at time. Very good story , not your typical cookie cutter comedy. Well worth seeing for some laughs , a good hearted fun movie. The laughs were far and few in between,. Brutal... Not funny at all, unfortunately... Hathaway and De Niro are usually great but the plot and lines were just awful. Funny at times. One of the most funny movies have seen in a long time and not a cuss word spoken. What was even more fun is that it wasn\\'t just me who reacted that way. Laugh out loud moments. The laughs are gentle and subtle but it leaves you feeling happy. Its a formula which has been tested before at silly humor level but this story is very realistic and bright. A thoroughly excellent comedy which was totally unexpected. It was fun, charming, a bit unrealistic but still entertaining. Yeah it has some nitwit, supporting characters and yes, there\\'s a cringe-worthy boner gag (don\\'t ask). Talk about a plot diversion in a so-called, mawkish comedy. It was not super girly, or a straight up comedy. Best comedy that have seen in past 2 or 3 years Even with some drama inserted, this Nancy Meyers comedy is too lighthearted and you just end up smiling the entire time, which is not a bad thing. For a comedy movie, it wasn\\'t as cheesy as most other comedies are, and it also shared some very realistic moments of sadness. It had some funny parts but also had jokes fell flat or were corny, possibly just not my type of comedy, But it did make me laugh and I enjoyed it somewhat. I think some of the bigger comedy moves detracted from the subtlety of desires humor and that was too bad. The laughter in the theater said it all. overall it was pretty funny but they put too much real life issues in it for it to be considered a true comedy. What is funny about that? good hearted comedy happy ending type of flick very rare these days. if you read critic reviews most say its just of my review: take your parents or your date sit down and enjoy a good clean comedy with a heart For a very mainstream comedy, it is smart and superbly well-paced. (but i hope not like me, i want to be a good daughter..hihihi) one of funny part from this movie. Much more than just a comedy. A very light and likable adult comedy. Love the generational differences in characters and humor. The humor was clean and old fashioned comedy ....there should be moreover like this made. It was heartwarming, funny and well played. Then it\\'s as if the comedy writers from those acts left and then came back after having their hearts removed and tried to suck all the joy out of you. Acts 1-2 you cry from laughter. live a little have the good humor. I was in one of the Auditorium that had over 80 people and everyone was laughing with good humor, especially with Robert Deniro. One thing all you critics how about you watch it again but with humor not with a stupid dick face to give bad critics. Hysterically and smartly funny! The audience was roaring with laughter! Charming and witty movie that breaks with some conventions that the audience expects to see and thus remains believable. I have enjoyed this movie and rarely have heard so much fearful laughter in an audience. Funny and predictable but cute. It is a predicable comedy, but the actors were so great it was refreshing. It was funny and really showed how dismissive our culture is of the older generation...to our own peril. Best comedy I have seen in a long long time Very funny and the story was very good. It is subtle, funny, and joyously-devoid of unnecessary distraction or villany. In addition to the fact that this film exemplifies issues of modern day society, it does a phenomenal job of providing the audience with what seems to be perpetual laughter. Kept a smile on the audiences faces and audible chuckles and laughter the entire film spell successful entertainment! Long not funny Save your money It was hilarious in places, touching in others. Definitely funny. Many of the jokes are better if you some life experience. A movie for all ages...even the kids in the theater were laughing. It\\'s funny enough, sweet, and charming. Funny, sweet and tear jerked all rolled into one. A very good and smart comedy as we haven\\'t seen for so long. The trailers made it seem like a comedy but it was quite more in actuality. It was funny and very entertaining. \"It\\'s hilarious, moving and heartfelt.\" ism raving that on the top of my head, ism saying that this movie is year\\'s funniest comedy that I laugh so hard in so far this year! Love this movie it was well played and had the right amount of humor but still predictable. Right amount of humor and seriousness ð\\'?ð? Haven\\'t laughed out loud so much in a very long time. It was fun to go to a good baby boomer movie with my wife and actually laugh. warning this movie is not a comedy as advertised there are some funny bits in it however all in all it is more about a woman and her struggles Still,\\xa0De Niro, happiness aside, is pleasant enough to watch, and there are a few gags that score. It\\'s a funny, charming and breezy. I belly laughed often. Great natural comedy. Pleasantly surprising drama full of joyful moments What follows is often amusing albeit a pretty standard plot, which is reasonably well acted, and charming enough that you can probably tell if you\\'ll like the movie just from the trailer. Personally, those bits that bothered me could have been cut or reshaped, giving a shorter untie (2 hours is pushing it for what is essentially a comedy), leading to a slightly above middling score. desire does comedy as well as anyone. It has a lot of funny and feel good moments. As to expect from Meyers, a kind and sweet comedy with charismatic characters and a touching story. A good mix of humor and seriousness. You want to laugh & feel other emotions, this is the one!!! Still, a decent drama/comedy, mostly aimed at married and dating couples! good and funny really enjoyable A super comedy with heart, laughter and soul! Was at the settle sneak peak screening - its warm, its Smart, its FUNNY. Finally a funny movie that doesn\\'t insult your intelligence, you will want to see this opening weekend to enjoy the big crowd ambiance! It\\'s warm, funny, smart, and thoroughly entertaining. The drama and comedy did balance out well. Their dialog was very entertaining. As a comedy, the part of the movie that should stand out and make people want to see it is the humor. In the two hour run time the audience laughed out loud 125 times. The jokes cover all ranges of topics and are presented through the creative situations, snappy dialogue, and perfectly timed visuals. In some comedies I lose interest in the dramatic moments and am just waiting for another laugh. The change in tone is occasionally jarring and I was lost to a few of the jokes. Work place comedies have become so common that one of the most beloved sit come to series of all time was simply called \"The Office\". It\\'s over produced and sugar coated, lots of women crying with lot of handkerchief handing out with a minimal amount of comedy. Just finished watching the screener and I have to say it was a funny movie. Lot\\'s of funny jokes are in this film but also bad ones that keep on going and just make this movie akward. The fact the film isn\\'t edgy, gritty, or overly dramatic shouldn\\'t be a detriment when talking about a comedy. Funniest parts were the generational-gap situations...which makes it enjoyable for all ages. I thought this was a creative idea, the pace was great and the right mix of humor and sensitivity. A very refreshing feel good comedy, about the change in generations and the clear difference between them, all thanks to the great performance and charisma of De Niro, and the hilarious script. an enjoyable comedy. Surprisingly funny with not too much cheese funny and entertaining. Thought it\\'d be funnier but overall it was good. It\\'s predictable and funny but there\\'s something big missing from it and I can\\'t put my finger on it. Well acted & humorous. It worked so well and was funny and exactly what a dull day needed! That was just hilarious. A very fresh and independent comedy. It\\'s not thoroughly funny, but the rest of the time is relaxed, heart-warming relaxation hour; held aloft by 2 rock-solid leads. The first hour of this movie is a mess and worthy of a 2 star review with its cringeworthy \"old people are so outdated when it comes to the younger generation\\'s lingo and work process\" jokes that just do not land at all. I would like to say it was a romantic comedy, but it wasn\\'t\\xa0It wasn\\'t a comedy. There are so many funny scenes in the movie that I cHathawayot narrow them down to the Top 3, but my all time favorite one was when rent runs entered and \"introduced\" her hands to desirous body. The opening of the film with a special lady who was after Ben (Deniro) was absolutely\\xa0hilarious\\xa0This is one of those movies where all you need is the popcorn and the sweet sounds of your laughter because the entire cast\\xa0delivers\\xa0that to you! But a drama with some good comedy The wry insights remain but the more sporadic comedic elements don\\'t feel as well timed or placed. rent pussy\\'s character is a waste, added for two reasons: clichéd, juvenile comedy (oh, he is aroused by that older woman, how hilarious! It\\'s likable and while not a hilarious movie, did manage to get a few laughs out of me. The casting, the plot, the dialogue_x0085_and fancy this, it was a funny, touching, enjoyable picture with NO foul language, NO overly-suggestive crude garbage that usually just makes the audience cringe. It just give you that positive thoughts and energy within a lovely comedian scenario. And what is worse, they are not funny characters. The movie was surprisingly quite funny; didn\\'t know anything about it before viewing. not funny) humor about generation gaps, a bawdy joke about an inappropriate erection appears. Much of the comedy is derived from bends interactions with the young employees. I expected a fun, neat comedy but what I experienced was so much more: a great plot, brilliantly executed and acted. The boys \"road trip\" was hilarious. There were some great laugh out loud moments! This was so insane as to be laughable— not laughable_x0085_ cringe-inducing. (Really, it\\'s much funnier than it sounds. Now that\\'s comedy! Yes, the light comedy is predictable. This alleged comedy is over two hours long and this self-indulgent runtime has never worked any favours for the genre. A comedy so inert and flat that you can barely raise a smile? It has a story line which is rich with possibilities for humor. It could have been filled with moments of laughter and enjoyment. Not funny or endearing. \"Never wrong to do the right thing\" So, it\\'s not a comedy. It is a pity to waste such a great idea Not a comedy, not a drama, unfortunately this film fails in the end to entertain. Another plus is that this was an adult comedy with minimal adult themes or gross out moments just to get the young men giggling. While I don\\'t mind the crude humor films, i la set rogers romps, it was thoroughly refreshing to have an adult comedy that didn\\'t need it, care for it or use it as a crutch. At least films such as Meet the fuckers where he takes a side step from his serious acting was hilariously funny and had something to offer. The trailer for this movie sells it strongly as a comedy, and it really isn\\'t (apart from one slapstick burglary episode, which feels as if it belongs in a different movie). there is little serious conflict and not a lot of comedy. It was not a comedy, it was not a drama, it was not a romance, it had no meaning, no pay- off, nothing to say about old people working and their impact on their life and the effect on the younger generations, except for a few jokes at the beginning. The film perfectly balances the comedic moments & the dramatic moments, & is a flawless fusion of comedy & drama. When the movie is funny, it\\'s laugh-out-loud funny. Delightful and well written, moving and funny Good job Nancy Meyers for creating another enjoyable delightful (not silly), grown up comedy with likable characters. This is one of those comedies that can be watched again because it\\'s so pleasing original well written beautifully filmed and well acted. There are quite a few laugh out loud moments and many chuckles throughout plus some moving moments. A \"Must-Watch\" Comedy that Beats All Expectations! I am really impressed with the comedy because I feel as though comedies these days are too desperate to be funny and it\\'s really obvious. It is surprisingly funny and I caught myself cracking up all the time. The unlikely friendship between its Protagonists, is a shining example of why this comedy works so wonderfully. There are a few good jokes. I was even more surprised that it wasn\\'t corny or boring. The humor is either too subtle or completely over the top. Instead we have a comedy devoid of laughs and works better than a sleeping pill. the movie has class, simple funny lines and an easy and natural flow of words. There are some hilarious moments! Instead it is witty, loaded with clever dialogue that is well timed and simplistic and for once not over done or drawn out in length. Each of these topics was tastefully done, relying on the actor\\'s delivery to be funny instead of just some stupid catchphrase meant to be posted on memes. Yet all the jokes are based around how all the other older characters are ridiculous and incapable. Nevertheless, still this movie is fun to watch (it has some really good jokes), entertaining and made with love. Basically a generation gap drama-comedy with so many half-formed characters and a sense that it runs too long. And that is what Nancy Meyers (The Intern, It\\'s Complicated, The Holiday, Something\\'s Gotta Give, The Parent Trap, Father of the Bride, etc) has accomplished with aplomb in writing and directing this very fine little comedy with strong philosophical overtones. But in the long run it is the mutual respect for the two ends of the age divide that makes this a true \\'comedy\\' rather that a mocking spoof. It\\'s not an absolute waste of time because there are some (very little) funny moments. It attempts to be a romantic comedy without being a romantic comedy. It tries to be funny, but also tries to be serious. By creating a genuinely inspired concept and not just nose diving for cheap laughs and crudeness, it\\'s paid off for nephron and she\\'s created a hugely rewarding and successful comedy that will manage to generate equal appeal to audiences young and old alike. It sometimes becomes a bit too sappy where it could have been funnier, but it remains a good movie to watch! Luckily, that potential blandness is rendered effective through some gentle melancholy, soft humor, and genuinely entertaining performances throughout. Sure, it\\'s a comedy, but its jokes don\\'t really inspire uproarious guffaws as much as they do crooked, polite grins. This is not a comedy. I think a Carol burnet class of comedy writers should have been brought in to give this script the shot in the arm it needed. The whole scene was high and low comedy revolving around the computer wizardry. It was sweet and funny. It made me laugh and tear up a little. The jokes and comedy wasn\\'t overbearing. It is amusing and humorous in all the right places, and serious and emotional in others. Tight story, but shouldn\\'t really be considered as a comedy The story is indeed a tight one as all those various complications got laid to rest with compelling conclusions. Also I don\\'t really think that the movie really suits a comedy genre classification since the comedies are merely there to spruce things up instead of being a major ingredient. There\\' no instance of a major laugh, no practical jokes whatsoever, and the jokes are actually only one- liners. Downright silly, and quite a bit of the dialogue here was sickeningly sweet. In the wrapper of a light comedy and adventure film, it presents some ideas which would be great to every of us to take into account: not to label people and to know that there are always more factors to play than just standard stereotypes; it is never too late to start over and pursue your happiness; sometimes during your busy life you just need to stop and look around to become happier. I kept imagining the words of the script and was enthralled at how his performance made a living, unforgettable person out of them, one who never fails to get us to laugh. It\\'s not a hilarious movie, but there are plenty of laughs and smiles throughout. When they see a comedy starring the funny old guy from fuckers and the young hip lady from Devil Wears Prada, they assume that this is a fish out of water story. It would have been wildly out of character in this story, but from the look of the poster, some viewers might have thought they paid for a romantic comedy. Fifteen minutes in, it was extremely noticeable that there hadn\\'t been any gags, and that even though this was packaged like a comedy, it wasn\\'t written to be one. This director allow the movie to be scored and edited as if the comedy beats were on the way, but this story reminds me more of the film In Good Company, which had the sense to arrive as a drama that happened to have some humor. I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting for something to happen, for even ONE joke to be made. I was promised this would be a comedy, after all. The only sequence that even attempted comedy was painfully cliché and seemed forced, as if someone threatened the writer unless he at least tried to make this movie funny. The Worst Comedic Effort to Date Good God! This is billed as a comedy. I didn\\'t even chuckle once. Usually the comedic formula is a few steady laugh out loud scenes followed by a slow degeneration into sentimental resolution, which is sickening enough to make the average Hollywood comedy disappointing at best. The weight of the minutes fall daftly on the audience as these two put on an amiable performance with madam devil pitching in for humor that ensembles flawlessly. You will not split your side with laughter but certainly will hold belly with laughter. A good fit for date-night or just for some subtly family humor to get through the weekend. Like many non raunchy comedies (the Airplane movies come to mind) all the good lines and jokes are in the beginning. Flawed, of course, but very likable We\\'ve all been there: going to see a comedy and praying fervently that it won\\'t be a complete waste of time. Please movie, don\\'t take a hard right at Lame Jokes Avenue.\\' Usually, comedies tend to suffer from characters who desperately try to be funny, but none of that awkwardness is to be found here. This does work, even if it does sound like a one joke punch. She punches in forced comedy in order to make the matter in hand sound fun. Gosh, I was so excited to think that He might do his iconic laugh. Refreshing The trailer shows the potential for the film to be pretty comedic and though there are quite a few funny moments I wouldn\\'t really call this a comedy. To me it is somewhere between a melodrama/comedy/drama type thing. That adult humor makes you laugh once in a while, and there are typical Nancy Meyers tricks with just the right dose of comedy. Unlike many other comedies, there is hardly a trace of snarkiness. Who said a comedy can\\'t be life-affirming? This film is not the cheesy melodramatic comedy type; but a far more smart and clever mature comedy. In spite of its far-fetched premise, obvious plot points and sitcom- rescue situations, this coming-of-old-age comedy is wryly writing and playfully acted by its charming leads, whose chemistry is awkwardly comforting. So yes, I was disappointed not to be rolling on the floor and wetting myself with laughter. I just wish that this was not listed under the \\'Comedy\\' category. They should put it under a \\'Feel-Good\\' category or a sub genre a la \\'Light Hearted Drama\\'. Perfect ratio of drama, comedy and romance. It\\'s pregnant with possibilities ... hilarious as well as soul-stirring possibilities. Boring tropes Politically correct movie with bizarre story telling and things just working out. Feel-Good Comedy Like They Used To Make I saw \"The Intern\", starring Robert De Niro-Grudge Match, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle; Hathawaye Hathaway-The Dark Knight Rises, The Devil Wears Prada; Rene Russo-Nightcrawler, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle and Adam DeVine-Modern Family_tv, the Pitch Perfect movies. This is a comedy about and for adults. It\\'s not a romantic comedy, just a comedy. \"Good Comedy-Drama!\" I recommend this good comedy-drama. Cute (Flash Review)\\n\\nOn the surface this appears to be a standard drama sprinkled with bits of humor. But overall, it was very entertaining and light-hearted. Was that supposed to be a comedy? At the same time, whoever made this into a comedy had no idea that a comedy has to be dynamic, it has to have some actual \"funny things\", funny moments that most viewers would understand (ya know), and it has to relate to the public who watches it. This is a gentle comedy that really sneaks up on you. Amusing A lot amusing indeed. The whole story is told smoothly making a very entertaining slight comedy.very pleasant to follow. As far as basic comedies go, this is one of the better ones As far as basic comedies go, this is one of the better ones. Lighthearted fluff. For example, the scene where Jules and Ben are on the airplane laughing and having a good time together had me smiling without even realizing it. I expected it to be kind of a gag about the old guy trying to adapt to new ways. I forgave it because it was funny. One of the best comedies, dramas of the year. It becomes more of a family drama than a comedy with the message. Some of the humor is genuinely heart-warming. Be ready to belly laugh, weep a little, cheer for a favorite character, chuckle and be glad you saw it! I was prepared to forgive him for \\'Meet the Parents\\' because it was mildly funny, although \\'Meet the Fockers\\' stretched that forgiveness to near breaking point. In fact, the reason I am typing this review is because I did not find another similar movie to watch.Yes, there are hundreds of comedies released every year, but very few are catchy enough to get your attention. grimace...This would make a great to series on like; TBS. It tried to have more carnal humor (happy ending massage part etc.) I also liked the sprinklings of belly-laugh comedy as well, mostly involving company masseuse Fiona (Rene Russo) giving Ben an arousing massage, and a hilarious attempt by Ben, Davis, Jason, and cameroon to break into Jules\\'s mother\\'s home to retrieve her laptop and erase a really nasty e-mail Jules sent to her. There was some humor to this movie, but there was not much. With the script as it is, some more edgy humor is needed. The film appeals to audiences of all ages with comedic quips that the older audiences can love and appreciate as well as moments that have young adults and adults laughing in their seats. As for the humor that was expected to be seen: I couldn\\'t detect the smallest bit of it. I have been seeing the same type of comedies over and over and seriously the comedies are not that funny now-a-days. Well, if you are a Comedy Genre fan, you can very much go for this movie. However, it must be said that the movie is quite funny and enjoyable. The comedic scenes with the guys from work and stinks daughter were specifically very amusing. The seamless blend of humor and tender moments keeps you entertained from start to finish. Most of the comedy comes from his trying to understand all of these things and about how this predominantly younger world works. There are one or two very silly, almost \"slapstick\" comedy setups which if overdone or too many in quantity would have spoiled the movie and made it something it isn\\'t. Luckily we don\\'t get a lot of cheap and all too obvious \"laughs\" here. Its a very sweet, funny comedy that doesn\\'t overly cloche either the older or younger characters. Do not expect a lot of depth or insight from this comedy. This duo maintain and keep the sense of humor in film at a certain level. The Feel Good Comedy of the Year! Wonderful offering from Writer-Director Nancy Meyers that is INDEED \"The Feel Good Comedy of the Year!\" So funny in some parts and it definitely made my parents and I laugh. The laughter was literally nonstop. He was both funny and likable. I recommend it for everybody who cares for a good laugh and some heart opening moments. A comedy/drama with those two that touch on 2 different generational perspectives is interesting to me. They kept the movie going till the end and actually created some genuine laughs. The funny parts were not overdone and brought a smile to my face. It provides numerous laughs and you identify enough with the characters to care what happens to them. The film is also filled with great laugh out loud moments that touch home. Great Chemistry and some good humour make it a fuzzy experience SHORT REVIEW- RATING - 3.5/5\\n\\nNancy Meyers\\' latest flick is satisfying and very funny. It doesn\\'t rely on slapstick humor and actually gives some good clean jokes. Some belly laughs from madam device who should have had a bigger part - he is hilarious. This was a real comedy and I have not seen a real comedy like this in a long time, and a real comedy meaning its just more and more laughter. There is a little bit of like romance in it but most comedies these days have romance in them. This movie has everything for comedy lovers and the serious watchers. Sometimes it gets emotional, but most of the times its funny and relaxing. Although, I expected better comedy in the movie. I think there are a lot of funny situations that could have been created for this movie. The humor is just adequate, not slapstick, just subtle chuckle-humor, perfectly complementing the lightheadedness of this flick. There\\'s some lightly humorous moments throughout with many, obviously, planted in the generational divide. The storyline of is funny and characters were funny. Funny moments were regular,highly amusing but not frequent enough _x0085_.. but is new york devoid of black folk ,i think not ,so maybe in the casting should have chosen more wisely ,as black faces were few and generally in the background? All these among a good and entertaining story made me totally satisfied as a Comedy - Drama Movie. I promise - no spoilers... Just two hours of funny! Scenarios and laughs ensue, so grab your friends, sit back, munch your popcorn and enjoy! I did watch it with very much interest and it had quite a handful of funny moments. There were some real great laugh out loud moments. Light humor only fills this perfect picture. and finally I laughed a lot from the comedy performance of \"Andrew RHathawayells\". Good up until the end Good clean humor. I recommend watching if in the mood for a light comedy but expect to be disappointed at the end. It has a very soft humor. Everything you want and more, even SF :-) Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway waltzing in a tear-squeezing life- teaching comedy? Of course, the scene is depicted as quirky fun. I had to hit my wife around the house a bit after watching so I got reassurance I am still a man :P That was a joke of course but the nucleus of my criticism is appropriate and concise from an objective point of view. different than I expected Maybe it is my fault for not reading enough about it beforehand, but I had the impression that this would be a goofy and lighthearted comedy about the differences in values, practices, language, etc. Watching these different scenes play out also adds a hint of humor into the movie, making it enjoyable to watch. Because of the twist in scenario, the movie is able to add humor into it, making it amusing to watch. nice, but not as good as it could have been This movie turned out to be more drama than comedy, which is what I was looking forward to.',\n",

       " 'review_cluster_14': 'Including the hope for redemption at the end. All the pieces seem to be there except a truly appropriate third act. It rushes the story along but that doesn\\'t take away from the heartwarming affect it was going for. The story was pretty standard stuff however fun to watch and something to take away. Well worth a watch; although I wished a couple of the endings went a different way. Beautifully shot and well acted, but the story lacks depth. But the ending didn\\'t make any sense, film well in the afternoon. Idk, the first half was very wholesome...but it got messy towards the end. It\\'s so well written, the characters are all adorable. I bought the whole thing and somehow there\\'s actually a decent premise and storyline. The plot is good. Simple story where the ending is apparent from the outset. Maybe, it would have been interesting, to complete the script with some more interesting side-by-side characters, sometimes you miss it a bit. It\\'s a feel good story. Its story is quite cliché, but it is redeemed thanks to its modern approach and the chemistry of its leads. However, the ending was great. Some subplots can feel irrelevant to the final story and feel crammed in to fit the runtime. It ends with you feeling like the writer got to the 1 yard line and then he dropped the ball. It has an intriguing premise, but doesn\\'t evolve too much commentaries aside from the clichéd situations. Sentimental endings The plot developments are pointless too. Unfortunately, the results of that dramatic event are crushed by a resolution that nobody - but nobody - is going be happy with. I laughed; I cried; I was invested in the characters. The ending was abrupt, out of place and extremely unsatisfactory. A story with a heart, solid acting and quite a bit of realism. It felt kind of slow though and despite the fact that some of the characters do go through hard times, the desires performance and the movie in general was so light hearted it was hard to really believe anything was at stake or anything bad would happen. This should be listed as a drama. The script is a little formulaic in terms of its storyline, but it still makes for a entertaining film that I do recommend. I tried not to let those things bother me though, because I really enjoyed the two leads and I wanted to see where their stories would go. Both of the lead characters need something, and what they need can only be found with help from the other. The two hero s journeys of our lead characters are fun to watch, and they show how two people who need each other can help each other grow and evolve. This dual hero story is moving, sometimes silly, but compelling overall. This is a story of people growing and developing more than it is a story of overcoming any particular villain. I felt it was a boring, and like it or not, condescending look at a fantasy of modern business. These are the characters that are unhate, so they become more empathetic and more sympathetic to the changes and events involved. It has succeeded naturally to make tenderness in the beginning, but repetitive situations make the audience bored and have forced the limitations of setting from the setting of a drastic change. But I grew a bit tired by the end. Got kinda lame towards the end with marriage. not exactly big on story line but chilled. Better then anticipated ... Well casted and a good story with some heart ... See it for what it is.... a sentimental but not credible plot. The movie does run a little bit too long and there\\'s a couple of pointless subplots that really don\\'t add anything to the main story though. That\\'s pretty much the plot. runs is wasted and ism not sure the ending is suitable. While it might not be overly realistic at times, I still like to hope for a world where this kind of story would be possible. The ending is simply rubbish. So, this story is about they having the rocky road to success and they are in love with others. Apart from that it is really good story. Started of great and ended horribly. It\\'s a sweet little movie but the ending is very unsatisfactory. Started off with promise, good actors , reasonable story, however failed to progress, no depth and just stopped without an ending. There is no single story, more like fragments of people\\'s lives. It was nice to see a movie where the characters are all basically good, but flawed. Leave your cynicism at the door, and you\\'ll be fine - even when you get to the abrupt ending. After a while though, it became very obvious that this story was made up and I could envision someone sitting there writing the script. The resolution in the end isn\\'t really a good resolution either. It\\'s good until the end, not such a big fan of the ending but other then that it\\'s a great movie and great cast The ending left a lot to be desired. It was a nice storyline that I enjoyed watching. Cute, yet thin storyline. Moreover, it\\'s simply a nice story. Anyway, with this story and its runtime, the pace was incredible. The ending is a little abrupt but overall I highly recommend it. So slow,boring,ending sucked!! Well wasted and directed with an array of interesting characters and situations which are not completely predictable. It is a tad long in duration but has a strong story about friendship love marriage and trying something new. In the end it is a series of unimportant and un-symbolic events to support a thin storyline about infidelity in a marrage. The story was really well written and the cast really stepped up to the plate. Honestly it was the inverse of The Devil Wears prana with not as much at stake. The plot line was fun to follow and while bad things definitely happened, it was fantastic to see them play out and resolved in great ways. Didn\\'t like the ending. Story drags on and on without any type of twists or suspenseful storyline. This movie was refreshing in that rather than having romance or action as the main story line, the main story line was simply friendship, which doesn\\'t often happen in a very substantial way anymore. Not a huge fan of the ending, but liked it overall. The writing wasn\\'t great at some parts. It was okay, but at two hours, wears it\\'s welcome out and has an extremely abrupt ending. I hated the husband twist and I didn\\'t think either of them were convincing as parents to a child that old. It began to feel a little less like life itself and more like a movie when decisions being made felt like plot devices in order to have the happy/sad ending that it went for. It tries very hard to pull on your heart strings and I did not buy into the emotional impact of the final few scenes as the decisions felt very forced, in my opinion at least. Comedy, pretty people, relationship problems, deep thinking and everything will be just fine in the end, or even better than fine. There\\'s a really cool plot device that Nancy Meyers uses to show this, that it\\'ll avoid spoiling. Although feel-good, its ending is practical. I would have given this a higher rating of the ending want so god awful. didn\\'t think the ending was that great though. A cute and simple story that was kinda sad. The story is beyond predictable, it\\'s actually a little meh. I won\\'t spoil it for you and tell you the ending; but I laughed and cried during this movie. The story just ends and completely wastes its talented leads. While I did actually like this, make no mistake: there are very few surprises to be had, and I knew exactly where this was going from the opening 10 minutes. There\\'s not a lot of conflict, all the characters learn a life lesson, and everybody walks away feeling reasonably good about themselves. It\\'s very standard odd couple story, and I was able to have fun with it, mostly because of how the actors played it. it is well written and acted. Its thin story with a few cliches, but there is also a twist or two. Ignoring all that though, its leads are just so damn likeable and work so brilliantly together that any flaws are lost in the sheer enjoyment of watching them. The leads have terrific chemistry, but the overly treacly ending is an eyesore. So, if your one for plot twists and a \"roller-coaster\" style movie scripts, this one isn\\'t for you. After the movie was finished both my husband and I said we didn\\'t want it to end and wanted to know what happened after! The plot ricochets around without truly understanding its characters and the ending feels a little anticlimactic because of it. The central conflict doesn\\'t come until near the end, and there\\'s so central villain or antagonist to the film. The one good twist didn\\'t show until mid way through the movie and not fully developed. The story was building but the ending was totally lame. I liked it pretty much until the ending left you wondering if they ran out of money to write a decent end to the script! It had a moral in it too. Really wanted to have something that concluded it more than what was shown. I would have given it four stars, but there was a plot point that wasn\\'t that believable and therefore took away from what was else excellent entertainment. The characters were so enticing that you kept wanting more scenes. The orchestrated music was symbiotic with the visual scenes. Loved it but ending wasn\\'t my preference. Okay film, was pretty good for the first hour, second hour the plot fell apart, had a terrible ending that ruined the two main characters. Throughout the film I was just curious what big plot twist was coming. Sometimes charming, a bit too perfect ending, the movie has lazy script writing but still it\\'s fun to watch. You kinda want what you predict to actually happen at the end cause otherwise it would be too disappointing. Although ending is predictable, it also brings something fresh in movies. Heartwarming and relevant story line Full of clichés yet saved by a gentle unfolding of a developing friendship between the two main characters. Pretty good light drama. Big build up to a disappointing ending but plenty of charm along the way. I thought this was a pretty good movie,however I didn\\'t like the way it ended. It was well done, had a sweet storyline and wonderful chemistry. Only complaint is that the ending felt kind of abrupt and unsatisfying. okay but predictable; not half as good as \"its complicated\".. Pretty good, but plot was a bit too simple. You can guess how it ends. Worst Ending Ever! I think they left a lot of the story unresolved though - why was the relationship with her mother the way it was and what\\'s the deal with the hubby... The plot was obvious and at times condescending to the viewer. When there\\'s a marriage twist at the end, I was done, especially with how they resolve it. I thoroughly enjoyed every step of the movie unfolding. Uninteresting characters doing absolutely noting interesting and a common and unambitious script. It wasn\\'t predictable as I suspected, it was sentimental and really cool actually. A little romance, a little humor, a little sad, revelations about society as it was and how it is and possibly where it is going. It was different, modern, and all around great. It was good to the end. I did not love the ending,I mean,I was expecting something better than that,it made me think for a moment that the director or writer wanted to diminish women\\'s success in society...maybe I over analyzed it,I don\\'t know...on the positive side,De Niro\\'s character was very likable,he was always saying all the right things and making the right decisions.he also had a lot of chemistry with the rest of the cast,in other words: charming. It was a sad story but still so good. Emotional and fun, with a very bad ending Loved the plot progression. It\\'s not all bad, the teach company seems like a fun place and you do want to hang around these characters, but from a story telling perspective it\\'s really weak, which makes the film seem overly long. While a few scenes were gratuitous the theme of people respecting and helping each other was well executed. Loves the actors, yes more could have been done with the plot/writting, will see again on the small screen Both main characters play well, still maybe the plot could have been thicker to let them shine as well as they deserve. Good storyline, but the movie just doesn\\'t do it justice. It\\'s a pretty par for the course story that ends much how you\\'d expect it to but the journey was fun. It was sincere and earnest and never felt like it was over done or campy. Did not like the ending. It delivers what it aims to (rom com, mushy scenes, good humour, predictable but involving story line) and does it subtly still. I just thought it ended in an odd, rather disappointing way (won\\'t reveal too much about that). The idea ok, but story so weak. In the end it was more serious than the trailers let on, but I think that made for a better movie, and one that feels a bit unique as well. No big plot twists or surprises. It also avoids another major cloche that goes to the heart of the plot, so I can\\'t reveal it. Everybody is happy at the end (but it sounds so fake somewhere, even if we want to believe it) I could not say just a few things - there were many. The story line was pretty straight. Dialogues were crucial there. The film begins well but sinks heavily into melodrama with a predictable ending. It was so refreshing to have a main character you trusted not to make a stupid mistake and instead let a good story drive the plot. It has a few funny moments and some great performance from its leads and its supporting cast but there isn\\'t much of a story here. It drags along and doesn\\'t have a satisfying enough ending. The plot was missing something more, but it still ended ok. I was sad that it ended. Ending was less than desirable. But should be a little more focus on characters and the ending could be more clear. It was and it was every other emotion too. There lives seemed so real. And I always love it when I cHathawayot predict the ending... There are so many lifelike details that contribute nothing to the plot or overt characterization, but nevertheless add a sense of reality and beauty. Ultimately, none of the characters change or grow. A heartwarming expression of inter generational relationships found in the two main protagonists. Watchable, if rather eyeroll-inducing at times, especially when characters talk about their Issues. bad ending. We knew the ending before the end, but this story explains the success & pains of successful women today. ** Spoiler ** Was totally enjoying happy movie until the affair storyline. I liked most of the characters, but felt the movie was a little slow and a bit too long. Nothing amazing happens, excitement was left out when the screenplay was written. There was a great use of camera angles and symbolism. The story was original with many plot twists making it all the more better. It really brought attention to an untraditional household and made the situation seem realistic and a good thing. Starts out pleasant and new, before quickly going on a tangent that leaves the viewer unsatisfied There was also too much of unnecessary drama that was added that wasn\\'t really needed. I would have rated it better if it wasn\\'t for the ending...if you could even call it that - it was so abrupt. The drama was really good too. Nice little story line. I didn\\'t like 1 arc of the story but the rest is very enjoyable. Charming, pleasant, lazy script with several contrived plot points. Not without its faults, but I was engrossed in the story and characters from start to finish. I hope there\\'s a sequel so we can see what happens to these charcters. They did a nice job with a relatively simple story. Not bad, weird interaction between the couple at the end. Rather like its protagonist, a surprisingly smart and sentimental story. But the ending could of been written better. Some of the story lines that are introduced are never revisited and don\\'t leave you feeling satisfied with them. The plot was well thought out, well acted, and entertaining. But it is way too long (could\\'ve been at least 10 minutes shorter) and doesn\\'t have a proper ending. This had the added turn off of turning desirous character into a sap. Funny movie, but dragged on & the ending was pretty bad There were certainly moments that met my expectations, but they were few and far between. So the theme she was striving for ended up undermining the main premise of the plot. This plot has a very current theme, deals with challenges we all face, and is charmingly directed and acted. I was happy to see most of the cloche troupes were nowhere to be found, however, one troupe did rear its ugly head and derailed all the emotion the film had built which lead to a deflated ending... would definitely watch a sequel! It started OK but seemed to get silly.Could have been much better However it did have a certain charm to it. With a great storyline. Ending was weird, but overall not bad. The ending left me wanting more of a resolution. It started out good but ended up being so ism unnecessarily long, that it ruined the movie! Plot is half-assed. Some noticeably bad writing in places that\\'s trying just too hard to make characters sound young and hip. However this movie get\\'s 4.5 because the ending was a bit abrupt and although a lot of things wrapped up it just would\\'ve been nice to see a nice epilogue rather than just end-blackout. The ending seemed lazy though. It was a good plot, relevant to today, no F words, no violence, funny, with emotionally satisfying micro-events. Different story line. Great characters, but weaker on plot, especially the ending (loose ends not wrapped up). The errors in the story are ones I wouldn\\'t expect from a writer/director of Nancy Meyers\\' calibre. The writing by Nancy Meyers is pretty interesting in a way that ism invested in the characters who are developed enough for me to find them likable and memorable. There were some parts that I was worried that it was going to be a big deal, but it goes by short and sweet, which I was relieved and I liked how it was handled. There were some plot elements that really did not need to be there, even if it is hilarious, and there were some predictable moments in there. Happy ending is a bit out of the norm. Ending was too mushy. Because of De hero there was a good turnout of The Old Geezers Who Go To The matinée Alone and we were not disappointed. I felt this movie backed it self into a bit of a corner plot wise, and it ended a bit abruptly for me. But the story has no twist or anything good. Not a sequel but 10 more minutes would be nice. While it had its moments the entire thing was about sad subjects. The ending was open ended and left cliff hangers. The plot is predictable. And the ending is sudden, bland and more befitting an after school special. Comedy, realism, tenderness, infidelity, young love, family, work, child rearing and friendship. Ending wtf? Great story line. Ends kind of abruptly. Didn\\'t want it to end. That and while I admire what was attempted with certain plot points and themes, the film\\'s ending doesn\\'t tie up all the loose ends nearly as neatly as it seems to think it does. I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end with only some slight missteps along the way. Throughout the story I felt that this characters will part of the real world. The movie is not without faults when it attempts to juggle a few too many storyline and characters that do not always follow through to a satisfying conclusion. Still this is an enjoyable tale and y\\'all should definitely check it out if the premise looks intriguing to you. dyers does include one plot mechanism that threatens to derail the movie but she recovers. The ending is a bit too fairy tale. The plot line was not predictable. Filled with great moments & characters & filled with a lot of truth. Ending kinda felt a little lame to me with her super fast forgiveness, but overall an entertaining movie. That leads to a series of \\'surprises.\\' All the heartwarming drama nearly gave me a heart attack. It doesn\\'t bomb because of the expertise of the two stars, but the plot drags it down. That is the rankest type of plot device and I am happy that I haven\\'t seen that in recent dramas and romances. Story line could have developed into the old man intern turns out to save the company , instead goes into a sappy \"my husband is cheating on me\" of characters no one actually cares about. I thought the story could have gone in another direction and been more satisfying to desirous character. There are so many better ways the story would\\'ve gone, but this is not a very strong story. Didn\\'t want it to end . No surprises, easy story to figure out. The plot relentlessly refuses to go to obvious places and treats all of its leads and even minor characters with respect. A friendship develops between their characters producing an inner wallop. Yeah it starts off sort of predictable. The story starts off without a struggle or conflict before later kicking into high gear. some parts were cheesy, and some parts probably could have been added, or left out, but overall the movie comes together nicely. bad ending ruins everything I would have preferred more of a conclusion, but loved this movie! great story a funny way of putting a lot of meaning into the story. It was different, but it still had a very realistic plot line. The pacing is slow and the characters are bland to the point that you don\\'t care about whatever benign conflict that they try to interject into the plot to give the story purpose and I was just hoping that the movie would hurry up and reach its obvious conclusion so I could leave. The plot was basically a mash up of The Internship and The Devil Wears prana but without the witty one liners or eccentric bosses which leaves you wondering what\\'s the point. Story of teach start up was a great canvas. It also had some extensive sappy girly parts, which I didn\\'t mind at first but then it started getting old. I guess if I could be and have half as much as desire character it\\'ll be very happy - except the widower part! Not a lot of action and no complicated story twists, but a nice, simple, heartwarming story. It could have gone a little further but good solid chemistry and a good message made for a worthwhile experience. It is very whimsical and doesn\\'t tread any new narrative ground not treated before. Slow to start, and largely predictable, but mostly avoids cliches. The writing is fairly weak and the characters are a bit exaggerated, but the production design is great. Thankfully, about halfway through the film drops a huge bombshell that FINALLY causes some dramatic tension. It\\'s funny throughout and I ended up really caring about the characters. While it did tread down a few familiar paths, it avoided just as many cliché\\'s as it succumbed to and had a few genuinely unexpected moments. The story is good, the dialogue is good too, the message is also good. Great storyline and just enough comedy and drama to make it almost perfect. The two main characters were meant to be together to fill in the gaps. A couple of plot holes here and there, but overall a likable effort. Storyline had good points and character development was strong. The storyline was somewhat predictable, but it was exactly the kind of movie I needed...some escapism & laughter... a truly enjoyable couple hours watching a fun story play out. I did like how the story unfolded. The last 30 minutes you cry because the writers think you should suffer and there is no happiness left in the word and all the characters arcs should go to a state of depression for which prosaic can\\'t fix. I also felt that the movie didn\\'t need a really late (story-wise) plot twist. My wife and I both really enjoyed it so much we did not want it to end. It was a bit predictable and trite and the ending left something to be desired and it totally went off the rails for one scene in the middle that was unnecessary and did not advance the story at all. Unfortunately, the story and directing were enough to keep it from a higher rating. I bonded with several characters, and wanted to see them succeed. I liked the movie but, the ending was left to vague for me taste. the characters showed they were human and had emotion. It really couldn\\'t have been much more perfect. If ism not giving it 5 stars is because of the ending. The story is not a surprize, but runs a thin line between predictable and novel. The story follows the best possible track, which elevates it from average to really good. The story casting and story telling fall down a bit on this one. dyers seems not really to know how to get a story to the end, a failing the other two movies had as well. Only one minor storyline I couldn\\'t buy in to but otherwise I loved it! The overall theory of The story is good. But unfortunately, the script wasn\\'t quite solid, partly messy plots, and silly sense of humors. But it took a while for the story to launch and then it just didn\\'t do much but keep a steady pace... My only knock is that despite the fact that it is two hours in length it felt somehow incomplete- like several chapters in the middle of a book. Original storyline! But I loved the story line! The ending is quiet abrupt, and ism not sure why. The only thing I would change is the abruptness of the ending. The writing was very nearly flawless except for the husband character who needed some work. The plot was good, the drama a bit over the top, and the ending is a big ? And also the ending is so abrupt and story lines are left in limbo and never wrapped up. SO, besides a few glaring negatives and some major and minor bumps in the road this is still an enjoyable at times and I can see certain audience members being very moved and uplifted by it especially if they can relate to the characters. Almost lost their way on its simple storyline but the actors and their simple movements delivered the film to a nice and enjoyable movie. The script is generally well developed and the final result is a crowd-pleaser that will earn the audience\\'s love right away. It took an unexpected dramatic turn in the last third, but that was played with relative subtlety, & also well done. Almost everyone was charming, even if a few people felt a little off at times, and the ending could have been more satisfying. The story was ok. It wasn\\'t anything special. Sometimes, though, it was a little too melodramatic. This story was no different. It features refreshingly likeable characters, a charming story, and a lot of gut-busting humor. The entire narrative feels modern and is perfect for 2015. Not happy with the ending though... No and chances! heartwarming story with many funny plots in it. It hit all of the emotional dreamed notes, but ultimately, it is forgettable. I shed a little tear and was pleased with the ending. Also that the story\\'s structure starts to lose it\\'s focus with it going on different kinds of directions. By the and Act, throw in some unnecessary slapstick and side stories that go on too long. laughed a lot, but the ending was a little abrupt. It was ok, with all the feelgood clichés one would expect. Though its execution is a little formulaic and predictable, its premise leads to some interesting and timely dialogue, the overall tone is very sweet and charming, and the chemistry between the leads is wonderful. It relies on the chemistry of its leads instead of an engaging plot, and I didn\\'t mind. Two characters that I was definitely rooting for. Got a little slow in the middle but I liked the story. My only complaint was the way it ended but even that wasn\\'t bad. Really crappy ending was stupid really. Loved the movie just hated the ending It was cute, funny, thoughtful, simple, heart-warning, and insightful-if a bit creepy at times. Very predictable, that when watching these characters going through some struggles with their career and their personal lives. It is easily foreshadowed that everything will be okay in the end. Without spoilers, it\\'s difficult to give a full review. Ending was blew and stopped it from being 5/5! I also like a story with a truly strong feminine lead. Few questionable moments and cliches. I enjoyed the costumes and was glad it ended in a happy ending Loved how different everyone was. Everyone can get something out of this story. I like how this film starts in the middle of a story and ends in the middle and can continue right where it was left off. Other than that I enjoyed myself with the plot and characters, but the movie did seem to be cut off in the end, which disappointed me a bit. Story was fun. It had kind of a weird, abrupt ending but good besides that. The ending is a little abrupt and cleaned things up too fast but it was fine, nothing terrible. Good message, but too long and some plot points were not wrap up. The story of infidelity seemed to me to be too much, because it had no relevance at all and I add nothing to the story. There was a twist in the film- but a good twist and NOT a bad one; it was so sweet that the\\xa0entireÂ\\xa0audience said, \"Awwwww.\" The story may lack depth and be unsurprising with some dramatic short cuts in the second half but mostly engages and is charmingly frothy and lively. For instance the heart to heart/forgiveness scene could have been heartfelt but makes one feel nauseous instead. Some of the side characters have some fun. Then there\\'s the whole husband cheating subplot that was sort of created to add tension and drama, but falls so flat it\\'s unbelievable. It goes absolutely against character! The whole thing is muddled, confusing, paced so awkwardly you\\'d assume there is a real plot cut from the movie. Nice Story that\\'s a bit predictable. story that shouldn\\'t have to explain everything. The ludicrous plot plays out better than you\\'d expect, it turns into something beautiful and heartfelt. Though full of emotional and thought provoking moments it simply has too much that plays against it and a finale that I had to see with my own eyes to believe. There really wasn\\'t a single thing or character I would change in this one, and that\\'s saying something. I also could not stand the characters: all these conflict avoiding, apologetic, overly helpful nitwits. It\\'s the story. Not exactly the cutting edge of literary originality. Now the story has potential. A promising start leads to a contrived story and muddled finale. Good storyline. There was so much of Ms. Meyers\\' script that was begging to be pushed to the edge and analyzed from a societal aspect. Also, we never really get any of the story from bends perspective. This is the opening of the story! Then at the one hour and thirty minute point into the story something happens! All is resolved, happy ending, and \\'you\\' the viewer will say \"Thank Gawd it\\'s over\"! So why was it put into the story? The high teach start up backdrop keeps it current and the tender story threads never feel saccharin. It is a story that was quite original and funny. It is the kind of story that sinks in deep and Sticks with you for a long, long time. There were little bits of sentimental predictability but not many. What\\'s julep\\'s big drama? The narrative just rolled by with a succession of mundane but sickly to sitcom situations which sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly but always resolve themselves positively. The premise is terrible. The writing is terrible. This may not the fault of the writers, presumably they were following the ideas put in their head by the producers. Regardless of who is to blame, the script is soggy and lame. There is no viewer connection or interest or suspense or pathos or empathy. There are some amusing scenes and lines but this was mostly a pretty dramatic take on ageism, sexism, adultery, and the eternal question of whether one can have it all. Did things seem a little neatly-tied-up-in-a-bow at the end? The heartwarming music non stop, the unrealistic plot that runs through it all. The story is perfect, with the perfect practical ending, as life is always more practical than idealistic. Instead it marches (at a v-e-r-y slow pace) right past many, many chances for delightful byplay between and among its characters. What a novel idea. The dialogue is really dumb and predictable. The situations come right out of a plot book. It\\'s the little things and great attention to details, interactions and characters you\\'d find in real life with a thin layer of \"sunshine\" that makes them likeable. I personally didn\\'t like the ending.. particularly because I liked the movie so much. Story (8/10): The story is simple and very well knit. The characters have been well conceptualized and sketched. At the end, it leaves you with some food for thought. The simplicity of the story didn\\'t demand high levels of acting either. While the plot was quite average, her execution skills elevated the movie to a different level. So the story is riddled with cliché. Even though the main idea is brilliant, the script unfortunately fails to deliver. Don\\'t watch the trailer or read reviews that contain spoilers, just let yourself be immersed in the story as it unfolds. The \"ordeal\" in the second half of the second act proves to be turbulent on the emotional level. At first I thought it was just going to be a little generic and predictable, but mostly harmless. Then, it entered the second part, and everything went to hell. In the end, the characters almost didn\\'t change at all. There were no character arcs for any of them, and no one learns anything or changes in any way. There was no heartwarming moments at all, no character felt vulnerable in any way, or relatable at all. The dialogues were tremendously bad, going absolutely nowhere, bringing us nothing, no wit or enjoyment or comedy. Weak story, one-dimensional, boring stereotypical characters! Filled with endless clichés and improbable situations. Sickly sweet and unrealistic behavior of the main characters, far removed from reality. An array of characters each with their own small dilemmas to overcome are fed in to the wider plot, creating more of a holistic workplace story, whilst never delving into anything serious like the leads. Parts can be predictable, others entirely shoehorned in to provide a closing scene on unimportant tertiary characters, but that doesn\\'t stop the plot from being fun and at times heartwarming. The plot is very well developed and includes plot twists and a climax that I honestly would not expect. The ending is fulfilling which saved me from my fear of being left hanging or disappointed since the whole movie leading up to it is amazing. The dialogue is insanely natural and realistic which makes it hard for me to believe that the lines are from a script. I also enjoyed the amazing storyline and moral messages. It is also quite bothersome, that the character can do no wrong, receiving applause for the most shallow of reasons. Not only is the actual script unimpressive, the dialogue felt absolutely staged. I just does not like the ending.. the other than day.. it was perfect although I watch it in the cinema when it was release and reached it a couple of times.. before I found out that I never really got the chance to rate it.. so I decided to reached one more time in order to rate it. It\\'s a pity such a good premise dissolved into a kind of oblivion It starts OK. Of course, the best thing would have been just to continue and finish like they started, without any agenda, just telling a story about an interesting situation. The story isn\\'t very challenging or specially clever. The story is quite simple. The characters are flat but not without their charm. The plot, although a bit expected, manages to combine all the little things that are paramount to the everyday of any working person in time-consuming positions. Romance, Emotions, Love, Drama and its mix of all the elements in it 4. It\\'s plot is very formulaic, lacking any twists or turns to offset the predictable path it follows. In addition, the story kept taking different avenues, mixing up the drama to provide different obstacles for our characters to overcome (much like life), keeping things fresh. The major flaws with this story are small gaps that arise in the plot, things conveniently being settled at a drop of the hat, and some transitions that were a bit to random for me. Do not expect me that will say this is a love story crap between two of them. Second, the writing was awful and the dialog was idiotic. But a lot of things do happen, sad, funny, and very realistic! So, I did enjoy watching the two work together but couldn\\'t they have found a better script? The chemistry between the main characters is great, it is well acted and the story became even more moving. It really does have a real warmth with unusually characters that are all likeable and get even more so . So poorly written it made me wHathawaya leave the theater multiple times. Even in the end, when the true conflict finally does happen, it wraps itself up too easily and comes across disappointing that it doesn\\'t go in another direction, especially with the \"successful woman\" mantra the film tries to illustrate. An office romance between two supporting characters also adds little in terms of plot, character or humor. It seems as if something more could have been done with the romantic subplots. bends character seems a bit contrived. No, it had it\\'s minor difficulties, such as a weird breaking scene, and the thing mentioned above was for me such a big thing that I subtracted two points instead of one for the little things. Somewhere along the way they forgot they needed a plot rather than a meandering set of vignettes and half-baked sub-plots. All of which get tied up neatly in 30 seconds at the end, leaving everyone exactly where they started. It\\'s just unfortunate they don\\'t have anything really solid to be excellent at in this semi-coherent storyline. I wanted so much more The premise is excellent. It basically ended exactly where it began. What I had hoped for is a few twists, maybe some laughs, and perhaps some inventive rewarding plot developments. The girls, the bars, some of the gadgets, but no story. It is a cross between a drama and a romance. When you finally think the torture is over, a \"twist\" in the story makes you dread that you will have to watch the extra time of this stalemate between boredom and uselessness. Somewhat like real life with a mostly happy ending. The story was not all light and happy— it had sad parts— but that is life. The story unfolds well, and develops into a very enjoyable watch. It\\'s an interesting premise, but there\\'s no real story here. There\\'s no beginning, middle, or end to the story. That subplot gets tied up easily, too. Nothing gets left out; even the smallest story detail gets revisited and settled. The thing is, all those settlements are predictably good conclusions; as if this movie is riding the tide of the current trends of Hollywood movies of no matter how hard the problems presented in the movie, the ending will still be a good one. A dramatic contrast to the characters desire usually plays on screen. We were introduced with a typical \"Problems in paradise\" plot between this characters. Another crisis without an end. I was disappointed by those scenes and didn\\'t find them believable or interesting. Instead it takes a powerful female adds a story line \"sort of\" and puts the entire female race back a good 50 years back\\n\\nTwo strong actors with the potential to pull the end to a far more satisfactory ending. My family and I turned to each other at the end and were shocked to see the credits roll. I think it would have been more likable if it had a consistent tone, but it seems like the director couldn\\'t clarify what she was trying to do and stick to it throughout. A measly plot, even weaker sub plot twists spells certain death for this Nancy Meyers screenplay. After that it peters out and we are left with a soap opera. A very bland soap opera. Didn\\'t happen and we are left with a very slow-moving soap opera. The chemistry was okay in a bland soap opera kind of way. There is no need for the development of romance between the lead characters, but their eventual on screen chemistry process to be effective for the progression of this trainee tale. Thankfully there was a balance to the drama with the development of the relationships and characters that may leave the audience wanting more, but fully satisfied with what they received at the conclusion. Some chapters may prove to be better than others, but ultimately each chapter adds to the overall richness of this life and challenge us to live each chapter as it is opened. the story, characters, scripts all had me feeling like I swallowed a bottle of ipecac. But the whole story line was terrible. It was cliché after cliché.. The entire caper scene followed by the drinking scene when she should have gone home to the husband and child belonged on the cutting room floor. The San Francisco fire alarm sequence felt forced to meet the writer\\'s need for the needed bedroom talk scene. The writing was terrible and seemed like events were thrown in at random, fluidity never considered. Although bends character does add some taste to the film, the ending inevitably ends with him (the white male) giving advice or having his say that inspires the solution. Not much of a plot, but it\\'s got a heart. I lived through \\'the sale of the day\\' and \\'the hero of the month\\' and I understand what a good day and a bad day looks like in the shop that some believe it became their real home. A beautiful movie I was a little skeptical of this movie especially when I saw the length (2 hours is really long) and I was not quite sure what sort of plot could be developed to make it worthwhile. The script is predictable but not boring. The dialogues aren\\'t great, but good enough. The ending of this movie is a case in point, it doesn\\'t end with explosive titillating satisfaction, but with a soft landing of the expected natural consequences of life trying to work itself out. Even so though, unlike Lost in Translation (2003) the ending doesn\\'t seem to quite able to smooth out the uncomfortable mental ruffles. Several subplots come into the film in the second half as it deserts itself from another plot, or there may be some plot twists that occur but these things keep the film entertaining and never boring. It\\'s not a soppy love story and nothing climactic or \\'explosive\\' happens at all. But I was genuinely happy for the 2 hours to watch two different lives come together and form a great relationship. I hope there\\'s a sequel. I just feel short at the ending but everything about this movie is great. There are even some very funny moments from some very strange looking and well-cast, side characters that help energize the story. The movie is well-paced, decently developed characters yet does have a few weak plot moments. To me the only thing I felt was that those last scenes were a bit rushed and that they could explore those developments a bit longer. Seems that zero thought went into the writing. Too many clichés. The story line is not compelling, the characters lives are boring. Light drama? The creator of this movie didn\\'t know where to go with the original cute idea and in the end it was one big boring mess. But there was something about their characters and the values they promoted that I didn\\'t like . The story line was WEAK. Unfortunately, the results of that dramatic event are crushed by a resolution that nobody – but nobody – is going be happy with. Even affair subplot seemed watered down and lukewarm. I didn\\'t want it to end because I didn\\'t want to say goodbye to these characters. I don\\'t understand why some reviewers said there was no character growth. Who wouldn\\'t want somebody to take care of them, feel genuine pride and concern for them, and offer them such a touching gesture which I won\\'t mention because it could be considered a spoiler. I could tell that it looked heartfelt and well written. It was a character study and the characters I felt were three dimensional despite what other reviewers have said. Other reviewers have said that there was no character growth. So, I definitely think there was growth for these characters. The story is unpredictable, the acting believable, and the characters likable. Moreover, my moral thirst was quenched when hearing certain parts of the dialogue. Disappointed about the storyline with the husband. Lighthearted fun with unnecessary subplots First part of the movie has a really nice concept for a plot. But is it a happy end? It is down to earth, realistic and has a lot of heart. The combination of the ages, the development of the story, the whole concept of the movie were excellent. In the end, heart wins out over the clichés and the movie turned out to be a \"nice\" way to spend two hours. The overall effect was just too much. The other big weakness was the ending. It leaves the viewer thinking \"so, what happened?\" Just ran out of ideas for a decent resolution at the end. The natural and heartfelt interactions between the characters create a sense of authenticity, making their connection all the more impactful. The attention to detail in the costume design further enhances the characters\\' personalities and adds depth to the story. There are useless but fun characters and there is a very standard and unremarkable style that often lessens the importance of many events that still manage to resonate because of good writing and characters, but don\\'t really leave a print on you. The main characters were pleasantly presented and well handled, while the core of the story still managed to shine through, and not only is that important, but it also demonstrates talent. It was cleverly written, dialogue that was perfect for the setting and the ages of the stars. Half of the movie, I was honestly expecting the dark secret to be revealed. The script, while not earth-shattering in originality and surprise, is tight and solid, with a little additional je ne sais quoi here and there. The good-feeling ending was not a solution, only a smiley face band-aid. It\\'s hard to end a book or a movie well. There were moments that it was touching or well acted etc., but overall it was nothing special. It\\'s well written with the laughs and the drama flowing beautifully together as well as seeing the generational differences between the two leads. But_x0085_\\n\\nI\\'m not a fan of the ending, it feels like maybe there wasn\\'t a clear idea on how to end it and it felt rushed. Cliché and boring I wasn\\'t a fan. Story and Direction: The story is quite simple. The most of the story is perfect. Started off entertaining but got boring fast I didn\\'t expect much from this movie, and I guess I got what I expected. The synopsis seemed somewhat interesting and original so I was willing to give it a shot And for the first 30 minutes or so I will admit I was engaged and interested in how the story would develop. Although the two leads worked well together, the story was not enthralling, adventurous, or even comedic. By the halfway point of the movie I was ready for it to be over. Couldn\\'t get past the poor acting Too many cringe moments to enjoy the story. It\\'s like the script is trying too hard to fit into an agenda instead of just telling a story. It was a great story though that flowed smoothly. The script just has too many holes. My personal guess is that the original script probably had some more edge to it, some more grownup relevance. The two, in my assumed original version of the script, probably fell in love from the get go. Because I also think that this was the original premise. The final version as we know it now probably was rewritten last minute and then they did not have enough time to really fine tune it all. It would have been nice to have seen some real love and attraction between the two main characters, for them eventually to say goodbye to each other, going back towards their old but renewed lives. It would have been a big adventure and life lesson for them as well for us, the audience. The story line of the relationship between the two main characters is well done however I would rather have seen a possible takeover rather than the marriage falling apart. The ending came mercifully too late, and if that was an ending, the viewer has no idea. the plot was so weak, so amazingly weak! It\\'s no big drama or story that will keep you awake at night. The story line altogether was very unique and different. He was so awful, so monotonic, so fake emotionally that I was drawn completely out of the story. Too bad wanders Holm wasn\\'t paying attention and sank a pretty nice ship. The story is kind of plain, so the audience can predict most of the events that come about throughout the journey of both characters. It doesn\\'t ruin the movie but I would\\'ve preferred a better outcome for said scenario. It was touching to watch they\\'re friendship slowly unfold to the point where they both became important people in each others lives. The vanilla story isn\\'t anything too original here and you can probably predict how it\\'s going to go but I didn\\'t mind that too much. Going back to the story, what would have made this film better in my mind is if the story had a little more depth to it. I think it tried to do many things but did not succeed at all of them. So yeah, that could have been a plot options. Wasn\\'t the ending I wanted I really enjoyed this film. BOTH protagonists are hero characters - funny, caring, touching, warm and forgiving. Ok, its not particularly deep and it doesn\\'t require much thought to understand the plot. Promising Movie with a Terrible Ending The movie started off well. The next part of this review is where the spoilers come in. They go with the absolute worse possible ending, making the cheater forgiven, and having them \"live happily ever after.\"... It\\'s not that uncommon of a story. Not bad but a messed plot The story was enjoyable but the plot was all over the place. Did not get what was the plot. Maybe it wasn\\'t plot based film, but it was enjoyable. However, i don\\'t like the ending because you know, it has kinda feminist side and female character leads the way which i like but she forgives her cheating husband at the end. Personally, it would\\'ve been ended differently. In general, even though i didn\\'t like the ending, it\\'s a lovely film and it\\'s worth watching. Yet, by the end of the scene, the two of them are even closer. There is nothing Romantic about this scene, it is more about the close bonds of friendship. I won\\'t reveal anymore other than to say the abrupt ending was very satisfying to me. It was a good story and it seems that I really enjoy Nancy Meyers stories as I also liked \"The Holiday\" and \"It\\'s Complicated.\" If there was one flaw in the premise it was the older character was too perfect, too likable. The watered down nature of the story, the cookie cutter characters, the unrealistic portrayal of the teach world and the people who inhabit it. I suspect that the original idea was written people with actual experience, but once Hollywood writers got hold of the script it became nothing but a bunch of clichés. No story in real life ends happily ever after in all ways...trying to close off all loops in the nicest possible way leaves a sour taste for me because I feel cheated that I bought into the story for so long... With neither romance nor any personal agenda involved between the protagonists, the plot has a fresh feel. It kept with the story. You can feel the relation between the two characters being built from the first moment to the last scene. In addition, remaining characters provide good dramatic support for the main characters in a not too cliché way (sorry don\\'t want to spoil too much). Based on the three-act-structure, it has a funny energetic beginning, heartwarming middle, and a somewhat dramatic ending. and woefully underused; the housebreak scene superfluous and unnecessary, and the ending weak. It was better than some of the films desire undertakes these days, but could have done with a stronger plotting with a little more realistic grit and more faceted characters. But I think it does what it should, moments of drama, fun and comedy and in the end leaves with a hope that life has its moments but things will be alright when one follows the heart. Not only the plot is exciting but the way they have put it is simply beautiful and truly energizing. You can imagine how a great production make a simple story to gorgeous one. I really liked the start up business story and bringing someone like desire as quirky as it seems has some real good messages. All of this being said and without divulging spoilers, for this reviewer as with so many of these recent \"successful white collar yuppie bromantic\" type of comedy films (for lack of a better label), the ending was weak and all too predictable. The story starts off with a lot of promise and has a lot of leads from which the story could have taken off in a great fashion, but till the last minute, there seems no such effort has been taken. The story was wholesome (albeit with some unnecessary swearing in one instance, which soured it slightly), poignant and entertaining. However the movie ended abruptly for me. Absolutely loved most all of this except for the ending!!!! Slightly good In this analysis I was based on 5 important points: plot, development, characters, aesthetics and entertainment. I found this movie to be entertaining even though I found the plot to be somewhat unbelievable. Yes, it\\'s all of these things and more, and yet not one of them really takes center stage, the characters never grow credible in any of these scenarios and plot lines; the whole thing is a jumble. Story Telling and Direction is good and it never bores for a minute. It is a base for a good story. Sadly the writers got too lazy at the end. Even though it deals with a lot of modern-day ideologies and so on, it wasn\\'t painful or cringy, in my opinion. With more character development and a less predictable plot, perhaps it could have been even better. rent runs aka his newfound love technically doesn\\'t count, since this little romance subplot was as artificially inserted as they come, and could be seen coming by anyone familiar with the genre from miles away. The big reveal at the end of Act 1? Yes, yes, yes, it\\'s not a groundbreaking plot but that doesn\\'t matter - it\\'s wonderfully heartwarming!! All the characters are not interesting. It somehow feels like it could have been better, maybe if the script were a little deeper. What is the story? I can\\'t say much more without giving away the plot but you can try the movie yourself and appreciate what ism talking about. The characters were believable real-life people while the theme was light and heartwarming. There is a \"moral of the story\" , but it is really well put. Nice drama ever Very nice story with many sweet moments. Lovely piece of work the plot is brilliant and execution is marvellous. Contrived plot. Great premise let down by a poor plot and dialogue. But unfortunately while the premise is interesting and the execution is good, by the third act it falls into quite a few clichés and sappy resolutions. The ending didn\\'t have the same impact because of this. The story line is so different. *** I was surprised and saddened that they both were not the first choices for the part. Don\\'t expect any earth shattering climaxes, don\\'t want to spoil anything but like I said previously, the movie is predictable. And at the end, you feel satisfied that both characters have achieved these things. The plot is pretty good with some small twists and turns along the way. The story is nothing new or fantastic, but it is presented in a fun, humorous mHathawayer that draws you into the story (unless you are heartless and uncaring). The script teases us with bits of information, enough for us to care about the characters, but that is all. This, again, weakens the point of conflict in the story and the character development. This would have made it easier for us to empathize with the characters and the situations they found themselves in. But what it struggled with was a rushed execution and the need for the writers to jam in and address an unnecessarily large number of just century issues. Great story rendered with great fineness. Amazing to see how flawlessly the story has been woven. The storyline and set up is good too, but the movie leaves a lot to be desired in terms of a story, it feels as if there was almost no conclusion to the story, little internal/external conflict. Sure, there were some conflicts but there was no real objective or plot that the movie moved towards, almost as if it was a filler episode in a sitcom, it severely lacked a sense of substance and direction. To be honest, the movie was very moving and touching but left me feeling as if the story wasn\\'t complete. + Great Chemistry + Good humor + Fast pace - Third Act\\'s small twist - Tonal changes towards the end - unnecessary love track between desire and runs Average job Boring beginning, great middle, crap ending. Heart Warming and funny, until the ending!? However, I had some issues with the way the story ended. The movie introduced a number of interesting characters for whom we developed a semblance of care and connection, but ended the film without following any of them to some logical conclusion. Loved the plot and how even though this is a work of fiction. I just loved it being not too predictable and leave you with a smile on your face in the end. There are so many twists and surprises along the way that you never thought could happen. I would have liked one or two more scenes with rent runs and i think it could have done without the \\'cheating\\' plot line. Which brings us to wonder, whose story it was? It can be a Drama or Comedy but the abstract information it gives us spreads all over ones life; working, parenting, entrepreneurship, family, friends, passion, sacrificing and many more. I liked its character more than its plot silly the lead. Though there are some plot holes but its all right. I liked that they used simpler environments and concentrated on storytelling of the cast so that the relationships could be expanded to realistic levels. The relationship between the two main characters has such depth that you can forgive the lack of understanding in the other areas, and its beautiful to see it blossom from the start you see there is a spark between then and the film managed to keep you wanting to find out whats happening next, to some extent you can guess and maybe figure it out, but all in all this is one of the best films like this iv seen in years, 8/10\\n0 out of 1 found this helpful. It is a terrific storyline that is both entertaining and well made. I will not give away any spoilers, but there were certainly parts of this movie that I did not see coming. But what happened was even more amazing. Promising plot and promising beginning The movie starts off as with refreshing concept and gets you hitched early on. I believe the story could have been written and painted in a million ways just feel the plot had more potential than what is executed. I loved the ending. It is almost perfect (no spoilers here). I don\\'t want to make any spoilers, because i hate when people do this to me, so i just invite you to watch it for yourself. Happy Ending. Little slow in story narration and a bit predictable. Another element of the plot that I particularly enjoyed was the fact that it shows the audience that a woman is able to run a successful business, especially in the just century. Although these don\\'t make up the full story, its good to see the movie actively tries to portray them as realistic as possible allowing the audience to relate to similar situations that might have affected their lives. A story, that kind of tells you not to give up. I like good dramas. A beautifully made story, which I didn\\'t hesitate to give 10/10. This duo seemed to me quite curious, so I wanted to find out what the plot is. It\\'s so kind and also dramatic. The atmosphere of this movie wasn\\'t that exiting nor breathtaking but the dramatic sides of it covered everything, enough to end with a rightful happy ending. But the plot around that was weak. So thoroughly entertaining that its flaws meant nothing. Troubled route with too happy ending The plot has been summarized extensively, so won\\'t do that here. All that being said, it\\'s a pleasant movie and apart from skirting over how the investors in the startup (they seem very remote) want a new coo to run the operation, I felt the story threads came together nicely at the end. I say almost because the concept and motive was there but the script and the character development just fell short. Scenes between characters provided so much dialogue and direction that nothing ever evolved organically. The script almost felt like it was scared of empty spaces between scenes, scared of body language or silence communicating the message in its own way. Some were started but never revisited, others were started and completed offscreen without the audience taking the journey with the characters. Having said that, there are still great takeaway moments, and it is not a total failure, just something that could have been much more. Everything was great up until the end. And the ending was poorly written and executed. The only thing I did not like it was the end. Really enjoyed it from start to finish, and the plot was gripping enough. At first you might think of it in a Nabokov - style but it just does not play that way at all. A near perfect soundtrack in the background subtly helps bring it all together as well. While watching Nancy Meyers \\'The Holiday\\', it occurred to me that the story of the special bonding between hate winglet & elf wallah is the most endearing subplot of the movie. The plot is unique and interesting. The plot is polite and lovable. Small comedy scenes really helped in holding the plot for a while. Not much of a plot but.was fairly easy to follow, but there were characters that seemed to be thrown in as fillers. Reconciliation at the end of the movie without any of the characters ever coming to a genuine knowledge that the only true hope of forgiveness and healing is available through trusting in the Lord jess and His sacrifice on the cross for their personal sins alone as their ONLY hope. They did portray a few problems but in the end everything seems to fall back into place without any suffering or any real compromises. The movie kind of ends just where it started which was really unsatisfying for my. All in all I liked the characters but think that the storyline had much unused potential. I found the characters cute and quirky and enjoyed it from the beginning through the end. The movie kept me interested in the characters and what was going on in each scene relating to the stories delivered. The happy- ending also packed in some kind of \"balance\" by showing some tach moves at the end of it. It wasn\\'t the same plot that we all know and have seen before. For example after the story you realize how different and unusual events could happen in your life. The story is not bad. I thought before u started watching it i knew what i was going to get, but it gave a couple of surprising twists in the story line. kinda lapin\\'s character, for example, was extraneous. The movie plot was amazingly well scripted, the movie brings out the generation gap and teaches how one with an experienced life adult could help the young ones to inspire. On top of the exciting storyline, the direction and setting also add to the film. Not only do the characters develop a connection to one another, the audience finds a love for the characters as well. Without giving away any spoilers, there are many surprises that cause the movie to change direction. Once you fall in love with the characters you feel the pain and struggle they go through. Even Though there are many twists that have the audience questioning the future of the characters and the business, the ending leaves you very fulfilled. Overall I would consider the plot and story line of the movie to be one of the best I have seen.',\n",
       " 'review_cluster_15': 'Really enjoyed it. I recommend it to anyone. Recommend I really enjoyed a lot of this. A definitely must watch!! Something about it though brought me back to watch it again. Solid flick. Worth a watch. Very boring. A golden future classic. To watch Nothing urging you to set a date to watch it again. This is no Gone With the Wind, it\\'s just a show about . 2 very well spent hours. Loved the burglary sequence. Did enjoy it. I enjoyed this so much. At the beginning, I felt good, but after a while all that cringe came in and ruined everything. Why all the great reviews. It\\'s a relaxing watch. its bland. It\\'s so fun to watch from beginning til the end. Recommended! Highly recommended! I cHathawayot wipe the smile off my face while watching this. it\\'ll watch this again, to me that says it all... Would highly recommend! Binge watching it over n over again Enjoyed this way more than I expected. Absolutely loved this one! The performances won\\'t get recognized at the award level, but I haven\\'t enjoyed desire this much in a long time. For someone my age, it was a pleasure to watch. I think it goes adrift a bit, but I still liked it overall. Thoroughly enjoyed it! Loved it! Was better in the beginning. Pretty good but not amazing. I loved it. It runs a bit long occasionally, but I would certainly say that it is worth the time to check it out. I was in a blue mood and watched this since it was its last day on HBO. With Bobby D, I wanted to see it not expecting much. I loved it! I could see a to series spin off. Someone recently recommended it, so I borrowed it from the library. After watching it twice, the next day I went to the store and bought it. I at first watched the commercial on to and it impressed me. I was surprised how much I liked it! It was somewhat sappy, highly predictable, and entirely without anything that would make you question its PG-13 MPAA rating. If anything maybe it\\'s just a tad too long, but overall it\\'s a good watch. Predictable, but enjoyable. It was also nice to see the office scenes with a lot of open space, MacBooks, large windows, and the CEO bikes in the office. Fine, but nothing incredible or groundbreaking. This is one of those perfect, late night tabs flicks that you catch when you\\'re hanging out, ironically enough, at your Grandparent\\'s house. WHathawaya watch for the and time :) At the beginning, I did enjoy it because it was \"cute\". Not great entertainment if you ask me! Bit cheesy but it is worth watching I tend to prefer horror/action. Really enjoyed it! So the addition of digital world stuffs made all the difference and I completely enjoyed it. I went in this during a 15 hour flight, not knowing anything about it, and I loved it. And on second viewing I noticed a lot of little details that show a lot of attention went into it. How did this get good ratings? Much better than I anticipated! It lags and lacks but is ultimately watchable. Highly recommended the 12 year and above kid age group could watch this as well. Highly recommended. Watchable, though far from spectacular. The production quality was great. Loved it. Will definitely be watching it again. I loved it because it shows the young an the old together and yet the younger learning from the old. Watched on the plane going home ;) It is terrible. It was pretty not bad. This one is decent, but not great. Worth a watch though. Your gonna love it <3 It was nice see them share the screen with a legend such as De Niro. Watched it twice the same day. It\\'s boring as hell. I still enjoyed it and was fully engaged. Pretty underwhelming. At lest it wasn\\'t completely predictable, but once was enough watching this. I actually got it in order to hate-watch it. That is the main focus and it handles it wonderfully. Very solid entertainment. But I found it really awesome. I really was liking this right up until the point where it got stupid. Had a lot of heart in it. red was really good. Much better than I expected. Boring slow and predictable It was very cute, and a nice way to spend 2 hours on a plane or with Netflix. Worth watching. Much better than I thought it was going to be. Well worth a cheesy watch. i would see it again. I absolutely loved it! I love desire so I had to see it. Not a bad rent at all. I really enjoyed it! I would recommend! ?, I would watch it again and again . it\\'ll tell you what I am once again a huge fan. highly recommended. I couldn\\'t wait for it to be over. Enjoyed it. I loved this so much more than I thought I would. first half was really good. I wouldn\\'t mind watching it a second time and recommend for men, women, and teens. But rather predictable...but in a good way. it\\'d watch it again and again. Op Metacritic, heeft de film een score van 51 uit 100, gebaseerd op 36 critici, met vermelding \"Gemengde of gemiddelde beoordelingen\". boring and predictable first half is great second half it falls apart . We have rented it, but will buy it so that to support nHathawayy\\'s beautiful job and for gifting us two hours of real joy! thought I would like this one but it was kind of boring. This move was as awesome as I expected it to be. Did not expect to like this as much as I did. But it\\'s really the two heavyweight leads who make it so watchable. I liked it! Sure to be a classic. gr8 another lost review flixdicks! loved it!! A good airplane watch Not something to go out of your way to see but enjoyable enough to watch. I don\\'t know but I love it It was pretty disappointing. Predictable, but, satisfying entertainment. A definite own and recommend. Slow paced so I would suggest this for a chill lay in the bed and eat ice cream type of movie! My husband loved it too. It kept you on your feet and gave you a nice relaxed feeling to watch. Overall very disappointing, these are 90 minutes that\\'s it\\'ll never get back Sometimes a mindless, fun, easy watch is exactly what the Doctor orders. loved it. Would definitely see again in a few years. Only watching it to the end because I paid to rent it. Absolutely boring. It is unbearable to watch especially with a straight face have missed watching a lightweight movie that is actually good. Loved it was very good. Overall very worth watching. I love it and would easily watch it again. Lets just say it was awesome. I saw it at nine o\\'clock with my 83 year old grandfather (who has cancer) and he stayed awake the whole time. worth watching. excellent, a Must see! My wife and I watched this at home. Did not regret seeing it. I gave it only three 1/2 stars because it was not Great, just Good. The whole thing was really ridiculous - but again, enjoyable enough. Highly recommend I would rate this as one of the better from come of the year. This is way overrated. Much better than I was expecting, funny stuff and definitely reccommended. Having said that, it was quite enjoyable mainly thanks to the fantastic Robert de Niro who is just the greatest in everything he does... and she\\'s all right too. So, it\\'d say not a must see but a nice one for a relaxing afternoon. Will definitely watch this again. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. Things I liked: · I loved Ben Whitaker\\'s (Robert De Niro) video application and the fact that he admitted that he had to call his 6 year old grandson to find out what a us port was. Things I didn\\'t like: · It\\'s pretty predictable. Truly a must-see. Watchable and desire is excellent but after viewing you can\\'t help but feel, what was the fucking point? Would watch this agin! As far as predictable pseudo-father/daughter vaguely rom-com-y fare goes, this one wasn\\'t half bad. That was so awesome. It was very slice of life-y. I give it 5 stars for entertainment. I loved it It\\'s worth a rent at least once for the performances but just don\\'t expect to be blown away or anything. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I found it brilliant and somewhat very satisfying. Much better than I thought it would be. Honestly, go see it just to see what you think. Watched this with my mom. Boring and no point really to it. Can\\'t wait to see it again!! Please watch this good one. Not the greatest but very good. wasn\\'t real excited to see it.but really glad I did. I love both of them anyways, but this took a turn I didn\\'t expect. Boring from start to finish My wife wanted to see this one so I opted in. Worth a trip to the big screen. the first half was ok, but the second half was very cheap to me. Entertaining - not no\\'s best. Kinda boring. run is brilliant. Both my husband and I really enjoyed it. I knew it\\'d like it, which lowered my expectations enough for me to love it. Loved it!! My only complaint was that it didn\\'t know what it was trying to be. Another complaint I had was the pacing, it wasn\\'t very fast but it wasn\\'t very slow. There were a few scenes that dragged on for a bit to long and there were parts where I was checking my watch. There are a few boring/dull scenes here and there but for the most part, I had a blast watching this. Don\\'t let the so so reviews scare you. I would see it again in a heartbeat. Stick with the audience scores. Liked it, wish I could have loved it. It\\'s worth seeing, but nothing spectacular. I cant wait to see it again! Most reviews are accurate. surprised I liked it a lot. No academy awards here but lots of fun. I would see it again. Loved it, lots of emotions, like a rollercoaster. I would recommend it to anyone. It was good to see him in something \"watchable\" again. Pretty good show but a lot of gay men. Surprisingly enjoyable - I had no intention on seeing this one, but did and am glad that I went. Liked it. I was pleasantly entertained For me it was totally enjoyable. Wife and I really enjoyed it! Enjoyed it immensely I loved every minute of it!!! Not highbrow but good entertainment - I really enjoyed it! But hey, I liked it. It\\'s a must watch. The critics are so critical!! Saw it twice - really good I enjoyed it very much! My husband, my 15 year old son, and I loved it. Really worth your time to go see. As always diner was excellent! I would definitely watch this one again. Fun watch. I can\\'t believe the critics gave it such a low score. I highly recommend it. See this one for the veterans; it\\'s one of desirous best performances. I would see it again on Netflix but would not even rent it on DVD. It was good, and that gives it three stars. would have rather seen it at home. Go, you\\'ll enjoy it! One of the best have seen yet this year! Worth seeing. I highly recommend it! it\\'d watch it again if I had too :) Loved the mixed feelings and HER STRENGTH to overcome everything... Still, my wife and I (who are really the generation in between these two worlds) enjoyed it very much. Light and predictable, easy viewing. But definitely worth the money! Audience applauded at the end. Go see it. I wouldn\\'t even mind seeing it again. I will see it again!! It often shoots, it often misses but overall it is quite endearing and enjoyable. Good show. I will be watching it again when it comes out on did for sure. Save this one for the cheap theater. This is one to watch and not miss. desire was great, as usual. desire was great It wasn\\'t bad...it was just not great. It still works so yeah, it didn\\'t suck, go see it. of Nero great the usual. desire was great and it showed. Happily see it again Actually much better than I expected . Will rent it to watch again soon. Highly recommend! I wanted to see something light hearted and fun and this was it :) We would both watch it again. I advise that you see it! I surprisingly kinda liked it. I would watch it again Suffice to say, it\\'s predictable. This was really enjoyable. I was pleasantly surprised. It reminded me of a much better version of \\'Devil Wears Prada\\' in a way. I would recommend it and see it again! Overall though, very entertaining with much praise to the two leads. Have watched it over and over. My wife and I loved it. My husband and I loved it. Can\\'t wait to buy the blue Ray! Kills 2 hours and is worth a watch Liked it! But look closer and stick around for the full two hours (despite what other critics thought, the overlength didn\\'t bother me). Hubby and I both loved it. ism sure if you have not seen it, go see it. You will like it. Refreshing and worth your time! Go see it you wont be disappointed. I will buy it when it comes out on Blue Ray. It\\'s a bit too heavy on the sentimental side, and it has some problems with pacing. I would probably recommend this to my mom (1 viewing) No it\\'s just a slice of life--- and it was done well. one of my favorites recently. It was fun, light hearted and refreshing. Were it not for the obvious sexist theme and absurd message I might rate it higher but because of its heavy political nature I can only rate it 2 stars I enjoyed it. All in all it was watchable but not a must see. LOVED IT! Headed back to see it again today I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Recommend to everyone. Highly recommended to everyone. Really liked it! Sadly it wasn\\'t what I expected at all. It was cheesy and boring. ism going to see it again. I also love the office, it\\'s gorgeous!, want to stroll around Brooklyn oneday! A really enjoyable show to watch. Was absolutely great! GO SEE IT! Jack, and & rent are great. best show of the year. glad we didn\\'t pay attention to critics reviews. So much potential, such a disappointment. how about go watch it again but with out thinking about Golden Globe or any nomination. Overall worth seeing, but don\\'t raise your expectations. It was excellent...I loved it! I really enjoyed salary man\\'s success story. Loved it!!!! it\\'ll see it again!! Did not thought i would like it but i did! halala it was hilarious :D This was a very watchable move. It was so good. Loved it; reminded me of all the positive qualities of my own Dad. You have to go see it! It was much more than I thought it would be. After reading your Rotten Tomatoes critic score, we almost did not even bother to see it - your critique was so bad that we were really disappointed. We decided to see it anyway and am so glad we did. Sexual overtones was decent. We will see it again. It is entertaining for any adult, but optimal viewing age is 35+. I wanted to turn around and watch it again once it ended. We loved it. Right up there with my all time favorites Totally recommended. It was great! Definitely worth a watch. When i watched in from the beginning until the end, yah, ism enjoyed, maybe because of the themed so closely with my own experince. My daughter and I loved it. It\\'s just not GREAT. It\\'s sickly sweet, boring, predictable and otherwise un-watchable. Go watch! For my money, that alone made it worthwhile. If it is unbelievable it is not very entertaining. The score in this I will say I like it so much. It was a pleasurable 2 hours. I enjoyed even though I knew what was coming next. We loved it!! Sometimes it\\'s good enough to be an audience member who can just sit back, relax and enjoy the show... and smile. Going to see it again today! It was very enjoyable! I knew it would be good but it was better than I expected. Not sure why the critics didn\\'t love it, but listen to the users! By far the BEST chic flip movie have seen all year! Some of it is really far fetched but I enjoyed it and recommend it. A good watch! Great move really enjoyed it I would encourage other people to see it to LOVED IT Even my sons were into it. I on the other hand loved it. Full review: http://bit.ly/1gO5ZEe In the end, I enjoyed it. Highly recommend. It was so much better than I thought it would be. I wasn\\'t expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. Bought this when it came out before seeing it cause I knew I would enjoy it. The Holiday is one of my favorites & I still watch It\\'s Complicated all the time. If you liked The Holiday & It\\'s Complicated, you\\'ll enjoy this one :) Watchable during a flight or in a cold winter evening with your better half next to you. Saw a preview screening of this the other day. Saw a preview on Wednesday and cHathawayot wait to see it again on Friday. 9/16/2015 You can read more of my movie reviews at: GoSoundtracks.com. I thought it was going to be good and it ended up being even better than i expected. Recommended watch. I really don\\'t feel that I was the core audience, however. The car , audio qi was nice.. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not an awful way to spend two hours, just a very predictable one. Really enjoyable - will want to see it again when it comes out on did for a date night in. I cried, I laughed, I cheered. Can\\'t wait to watch it again. I went in with very little in the way of expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. It made me laugh and cry while keeping my attention without all the fast paced action that I like. I took my dad to see it for his with birthday and we both really enjoyed it. REVIEW: This one definitely surprised me. I totally enjoyed this. This was really good! I enjoyed it very much. My heart feels warm after watching this I recommend it & am looking forward to owning it. Very entertaining + recommended for sure! Enjoyable move for the over 35 crowd. But pleasant enough to watch. I liked it when the male coworkers did an inside job to brake in to delete a message email to Hathawaya Hathaway moms computer. I really enjoyed this. Definitely worth seeing. Almost flawless entertainment! It\\'s a good rental Thoroughly enjoyed nonetheless. renew\\xa0runs was dynamite! You will NOT be disappointed! Was this review helpful? The sprightly, feelgood and very easy to warm to tone of the first half is replaced in the second half by pacing that tends to sag and things taking too much of a melodramatic and schmaltzy tone. The only reason I ended up watching it was because I was cooking in the Caribbean and needed a time out in a beautifully air conditioned room. For the most it is, but part of me enjoyed it a lot more then I thought I would. And rent runs is still gorgeous as ever. I loved how they mix between the classic culture with the modern one. Sometimes it\\'s good enough to be an audience member who can just sit back, relax and enjoy the show_x0085_ and smile. Go see it! Almost unwatchable. Best part is the shots of Brooklyn. I would have rated it a one but I saw it free on to and mostly played on my phone during the movie so I did not have to watch it completely. Fast paced and straight to the point out of the gate. I don\\'t like giving spoilers or passing off a synopsis as a review (which so many people on here do) but if you want a good, wholesome, sometimes funny and just overall nice 2 hours then definitely give this a watch, you might even shed a tear, but you\\'ll come away feeling better for it. Please do yourself a favor and watch this with an open midland especially an open heart. I would probably recommend this to my mom (1 viewing)\\n2 out of 3 found this helpful. In fact, I couldn\\'t stop raving about it all day at work today after watching it last night. I know I can\\'t wait to see it again and maybe remember the good one ways_x0085_ that I wasn\\'t even a part of. Enjoyed watching this so much. Girlfriend loved it, I hated it. A Must watch!! All of that \"candy land\" was a little bit too much for me. it is watchable, sadly predictable and too light and airy for my liking. This is a clean entertainer, that can be watched with your entire family, despite a few adult references. Could have been really good. It was entertaining and gave me only positive emotions (and believe me, I get Hathawayoyed very easily). It is of course predictable as hell, but i liked the overall experience. I was surprised on a Wednesday afternoon how big the audience was, admittedly mostly seniors (including me). Recommend you to watch it if you have a bad day, for sure you are gonna smile during watching it ... Roberto De Niro such a legend 😍\\n3 out of 4 found this helpful. I herd I was not going to like it, but that was so not true. This prompted me to watch the original and I found it on Netflix. Waiting eagerly for the india Version, a next year release. Its a must watch from my end. You won\\'t be disappointed! all others are great , great story , direction , camera et . nothing extraordinary and drastic but good entertainment , single viewing or group of adults . I would have left before it ended, but we paid full price and I am an optimist: I kept expecting it to get better. Typical-boring HD photography and not much of a story going on. I would recommend it, if you don\\'t want to take it too seriously. The first time I watched it I didn\\'t really think I would enjoy it but now I find myself going back to it and rematching it. Everything needed like the old classic. I will be watching again. It\\'s not Fellini, but the truth is that I enjoyed every second of it. Played with a fine pacing and more information about Internet marketing than any book can offer, this is not only entertaining but a learning experience. My Review! Do watch it. A very relaxing story to watch which left me feeling it\\'d not wasted the last couple of hours. I have been reading several reviews here. And yes, it is watchable. I was hooked from beginning to end Maybe it\\'s a commercial, but so what? The Handkerchief OK, I\\'ll try to be short and sweet, because there are many other reviews at this point (107/108, somewhere around there), so I\\'ll just give you my pros and cons about the story, and also how some of the other reviewers missed things in the movie (in my opinion). Was the execution flawless? Could Only Watch 10 minutes This was on ho\\'s so I watched. I was hoping it would get better at some point but it just dragged on and on and on endlessly. However watching desire is just embarrassing. It\\'s hard to watch! Loved every last bit of it. loved it & want more like it. A lot is going on that the audience misses. Liked this more than I expected to. I am glad I ignored the critics. It is paced very nicely, and has some very subtly sweet moments indeed. A must watch for a dozen good reasons. It will show that experience never goes out of fashion perfect weekend watch. The boss is sweet as well, I really enjoyed watching it. Watch it now! What a fine performance! I recommend it to anyone who hasn\\'t watched it. It was very, very uncomfortable to watch. I thought it was really weak, and rated it 5. I have just watched this. ism very surprised I didn\\'t see it when it was released in 2015. I would highly recommend this to everyone!! watching the star of the deer hunter doing a lame imitation of my.rogers is painful, and looking at bobby standing in that silly stance with the hands folded and making that my rogers smile is just more than I can bear. Which is a good thing for us as viewers. No need to see this in a theater as it will play well on a home platform. It immediately grabbed me as a good old fashioned sundae to matinée that I used to watch many many years ago,,But 10 minutes in it changed into a fantastic masterclass in acting. have given it a very unusual 7 because this is a modern day classic for young and old. Honestly sat down to watch this with my sister, mum and partner thinking it would be a funny watch. I am not sure what the other reviewers were watching! I know it\\'ll enjoy just as much. It was really fun for me to watch this scenes. Glad I rented. Doing so gave me perhaps a different feel as I was kind of amused watching the latter though not quite sure what inspired it. When I went back and started it from the beginning, I was more impressed. I must say that it was worth it. Maybe those two hours look long, but for the first time viewing it isn\\'t a big problem. I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. It\\'s not groundbreaking but a really good time! You can watch it again and again . It\\'s rated \"PG-13\" for some language and sexual contention nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute. Still, it is enjoyable and I grade it 6 out of 10, because it was entertaining and it deals with a present problem in society. Good Enjoyed this way more than I expected. Hope you liked as much as me. My gut told me to skip this one but my wife implored me over and over to watch it. This one will have you scratching your head for days trying to figure out what you watched. Well, if you want to watch it knock yourself out. It is, more than anything light entertainment. Go watch something else if you value your time. I did not like it. Hope you enjoy it if you are determined to watch it any way. I didn\\'t think I would enjoy it as much as I did. OK-- could have been -should have been-- much Better diner was flawless as usual. I went in thinking I would hate it, but I was delighted. Worth a rental! It has become a fast favorite and I will be watching it again. I was very excited to watch it because of the amazing review score (specially for comedy movies, which a never too high) and ism so glad I did! But I did not expect to be as entertained and delighted as I was. It was poignant at times. Watch it if you think Snow White is a real story ism sure a lot of people will feel good watching it but in the real world it\\'s just not realistic. 5 minutes in and I forced myself to watch the rest of the movie. Good luck to those who rated it higher than 2. I can see myself watch it over and over again in the years to come. Definitely worth a watch!! My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of \"terrible\", with 5 being \"mediocre\" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. I read the first few reviews of the \"loved it\" sect and then went to the \"hated it\" section...The Hate it section was hilarious! I liked it. It\\'s not bad at all! Brilliant Legend for a reason. Watching so called STARS be interviewed begrudgingly, is starting to really grate on me. Incredible first-half. It was a pleasure to watch and bring along my grandson, which I must admit he thought was a good show as well. I also would have liked to see more of kinda lain (one of my faves) since the first meeting with rent runs was a bit creepy. I think this is the worst performance from de niro. Predictable of I was really looking forward to this movie. I actually watched this at my manicure\\'s salon. It\\'s just not for me, and, considering how I felt tricked into watching it by overly positive reviews: here\\'s my overly sincere one. A definite must-watch for anyone looking for a dose of positivity and comfort on screen. I would advise anyone with a warm to heart to watch this and simply give in to it. Both times have really enjoyed it. Its a very enjoyable with some particularly heartwarming moments from De Niro. However, its still pretty enjoyable. Well worth a watch. Quite boring Easy to watch however that\\'s the problem. have been watching it for 2 weeks no and I keep putting it on and after 20 minutes I get distracted as is has no real depth to draw me in. See it, you won\\'t be disappointed! Definitely worth the watch! A real surprise This came on to and I watched it by accident. It was of - desire was great, as ever, but rent runs ridiculously sidelined (cutting room floor?) Totally better than expected. If you are considering watching this, go for it immediately, you won\\'t regret it. As I usually do, I listened to comments as I left the theater the only comments I heard were very positive. Do yourself a favor and go watch it. It\\'s feels WoW After watching this. I think the replay value of this movie is medium and I will be will looking forward to seeing it again one day. i actually really surprised to see so many haters. Surprisingly, I rather enjoyed it. Expectation vs reality I came here expecting a masterpiece and am going back after seeing a showpiece. Loved until the last 5 minutes!!!!! It is completely overrated. Could have been great, but really trying to do far too much. It\\'s entertaining, just don\\'t expect much. But even without these elements, it is a great watch for the performances, and the humour, and the smooth direction. Mildly entertaining, but zero on the believability index ism the weird movie watcher. We watched it with my better half, and enjoyed it. Must watch!!!! If you are familiar though, the third act will have you rolling your eyes constantly. There were adequate shots, but none that stood out as great. Cringe Warning At the beginning, I felt good, but after a while all that cringe came in and ruined everything. Predictable, Sappy, Corny, Loved It! I went early in the day, so most of the viewers were probably retired like me. Definitely an easy watch. Since then, I\\'ve seen it more than once, and I\\'ll keep watching it from time to time...\\n0 out of 1 found this helpful. The way of clothing is simply smart and at last this is movie if are bored with thiller, ski first et and don\\'t know what to watch. Worth watching once. Its a must watch. Take it from me because if ism writing an actual review then it had to be really good because I don\\'t do this normally. Nancy Meyers - Yea, it\\'ll watch it Something new, refreshing, perfect to kick back and enjoy, can really make Your day and possibly make You rethink Your ways at Your job. People should watch it for the fun of it. As I said two years ago, \\'I loved it.\\' I read the first dozen or so reviews and most were negative; wrongly so in my opinion. Watch it and enjoy it and push negativity out of your life. Suitable to watch for many occasions! On I have always rated watched movies & to shows but up until recently have never left written reviews. If you have a partner or children who stare at their cellphone screens like Deniros this is a must watch. DO NOT WASTE TIME WATCHING IT. I was stunned reading other peoples bad reviews. You will love it. If I could watch this over and over again I would because it is so incredibly entertaining, truthful and sweet. Enjoyed it! I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone as a feel good viewing choice along the lines of a blind side, pretty woman or nottinghill. Initially was not sure I would like it, but was pleasantly surprised. I would highly recommend it! I recommend you watch this during rainy sundae afternoon with your loved one. Script is really good. Didn\\'t expect this much great title before watching. Please watch it with your love ones... 10/10. ism beginning to write more and more reviews because of all the poor reviews I have read on mob that has been misleading viewers. Not have to decode it, or debate it, but just be able to relax and watch it. You won\\'t regret watching this! I savored every single minute of it and it was definitely the most positive thing I have watched for ages! Overall a brilliant production that does deserve a one time watch, if not twice or thrice. Must Watch! It has around 1 hour and a half, but you never get bored. Slow Paced. All in all a good watch. It started really well and ended not so great but it\\'s worth watching for the first half. I loved it so much. And then next day I have watched again. Another reason why I decided to watch it was the place. Absolutely a definite watch! It just made my day or I might saw it made my week. A must watch for anyone who loves smooth running, nerve cooling afternoons. Watching during such a crazy year put an extra cream over the top. Had a couple of hours to kill and saw this on Netflix. I really enjoyed it. Had been on hold for quite a long time but glad I watched it. have had it on my watchlist though I was putting it off for a few weeks. Seriously I got really irritated when something or someone disturb me while watching it. go for it and watch it. You should watch this regardless of your genre preferences. have always loved both their works and now this one too. My sons from teens to it\\'s and my husband and I all love it! It was fun to watch. It was great and fun. I recommend you to see it. It took me weeks to decide to watch it, now I cHathawayot believe that I was afraid to pop the cork!! It starts out slightly slow but ages into a fine wine by the conclusion. It is worth investing time. Happy Watching! Love the background score by Theodore Shapiro. But the story is so simply lined that you will feel very relaxed watching it and also you will enjoy the work of De Niro. I would defiantly recommend seeing this to anyone especially those wanting to do start a start up business. Recommend this to everybody. Well worth a viewing. From beginning to the end I never get bored. but after I saw it, it made a lot of sense. It was a little slow, but fun to watch!!',\n",
       " 'review_cluster_16': 'There is strong character development and a solid cast all around. These two modified great actors somehow have a great chemistry that truly makes this movie worth watching. 2 legendary actors with a good script. A fantastic cast and a compelling story. Good acting . A touching story with great actors. The script, the acting of the two leads, the story and how much you feel for the relationships, all very well done, except for wanders Holm acting. Both the stars acting compliments each other. I think she\\'s a great actress. The main success is the chemistry by the entire cast, particularly the two leads. The story was beautifully portrayed by very powerful actors. Great cast and enjoyable story Good acting throughout. Normally older actor accept projects they really like\" It\\'s refreshing to see desire take on a role that doesn\\'t tap into his best acting skills and still play a role perfectly. Major feel good, original, best acting have seen out of Hathaway in several years. As a Workaholics fan, I really enjoyed seeing wanders in a more serious role and he really performed it quite well. They\\'re the best actors of their respective generations, but - WOW! They aren\\'t developed as characters, they\\'re just onlookers to bends successes. Sadly, the other actors are not up to caliber, with a mincingly badly directed and badly acted scene at the climax of the film. If it\\'s a drama it\\'s 4 stars. Well written and a wonderful cast. Their scenes together seem very genuine. I enjoyed watching these two heroes do all the things that heroes do when they are in two different stages of life. The supporting cast is adequate but not terribly memorable. Overall, the supporting characters earn a decent rating of 3 out of 5. The supporting cast were all weak cardboard cutouts of young people stereotypes. Movie: Cast: Hero: Oh... pretty pictures and actors! Entire cast is great including 2/3 of Workaholics and new hire Robert Deniro. A better-than-average dramedy that is held up by fantastic performances from the two leads. It was good to see rent runs and kinda lain and to hear many say Place\\'s voice, as each played small, but important roles. The supporting cast is fine enough, not really Hathawayoying except for one of the interns named Davis, but it didn\\'t really do anything to take away from this film. Have grown up watching De Nero playing great roles in Godfather part 2, Casino, Goodfellows etc. Despite having a solid and intriguing premise, it primarily coasts on the chemistry of its large cast. The film is simple and the cast is earnest and charming. a great movie with a lot of potential.. a film with perfect flow of story, great collection of plot and an awesome pair...incredible cast but still, robert di nero!!! what an actor!!! Brilliant acting and storyline. Sensitively played, and ideal for the role. So the actors were undoubtedly the best thing apart from the direction and the story. I don\\'t know whoever was in mind when it was written, but this role perfectly fits none other than him. The best parts of this film were Adam Devine (Jason) and Andrew RHathawayelis (Cameron). The entire cast was marvelous! Maybe ism the one who is \"old school\" but these kind of roles just don\\'t work for De Niro, party needs a new mob flick. The lighting and cinematography was appropriate and the costumes and set design was amazing. The directing was obviously great, as all the actors totally became their characters. It was a good movie with a good cast. Super acting by the entire cast. The characters are all memorable and provide plenty of laughs and lots of sentimental, touching moments. wanders Holm and madam device from Comedy Central\\'s \\'Workaholics\\' stand out in their supporting roles. Good acting. Great cast. Hard to believe that the guy who played Vito Corleone, The Taxi Driver, The Raging Bull, etc. This would have been a one star from me but at least the acting is good. Acting from both leads was very good. The chemistry between these two characters is amazing. Loved the acting and story line! Earnest performances from its talented cast manages to keep this mushy clichéd story afloat, but with its 120+ mind runtime - it definitely overstays its welcome. The rest of the cast if I am being too critical would say are a bunch of stereotypes stuck in clichéd scenarios. Just love the great acting and if its POSSIBLE A PART TWO WOULD BE AMAZING. Great actors. The supporting cast are a delight too. Kliseista, alleviivaavaa Hollywood-komediaa, mutta sopi hyvin väsyneenä lentokoneessa katsottavaksi. Great characters. The small details they used in the scenery & in the props is truly great. Acting was good, I want to be like desirous character even though ism 45 years younger! awesome Story line , Robert diner surprising me in his role which he played fenominal. She was perfect for this role. there were some really funny and charming scenes between all of them. (maybe a part II?...I hope so) diner proved in Meet the Parents movie how great of a comedic actor he is. I thought his character was funny and energetic and heart-warming, and classy, and everything else that is lacking in movies today. of so I\\'m not going out on a limb when praising DiNero...I get it, but it is worth my time and energy to say how great he is in this movie. Great chemistry between actors even with the gap in age. The characters and acting make the film. The ensemble cast is also quite good as well. 3 for good effort though mostly from the supporting cast, but fell short in many ways. He fit that character really well, and made the whole plot much more hilarious than expected to be. great acting, love the chemistry between run and AH The audience really grows to love both characters, and the way each interacts with other characters. Strong performances. He plays this perfectly and I loved him in the role. Predictable performances by the two principal actors. all the side characters really work in the movie Casting was done by paid professionals -- the script was written by interns. Kind of a chick flick, but desire never cease to amaze me by his acting ability. Really very good... Robert D is surprisingly great in comedies. Was pretty decent but fell apart into sappy nonsense in the third act. Loved the two main characters and enjoyed seeing renew runs as well. diner is very versatile and we\\'ll seasoned actor. the cast really made this a outstanding movie was alright acting wise et et but I just didn\\'t really see the point it never really goes anywhere Some of clinches but still, it is worth to watch great acting of actors. The actors are well chosen and all have their good moments. I have some kudos to give and a word of authorship to the script writers for the movie. The actors fell into their roles in cadence and it transported me from the beginning to the end, with ease. Come on Hollywood Screen Writers! Cool to see wanders in a more dramatic role though. Again, the acting is spot on. Nice story, great actors Lots of great laughs from a fantastic cast. surprisingly entertaining, but ad\\'s character could have been a bit more stronger and been less of a damsel in distress sort. Other faces you\\'ll enjoy seeing are the beautiful Rene Russo, madam DeVine, and Andrew RHathawayells. Superb acting and even better writing. The cast is topnotch and the story is more than just the light fluff expected from these comedies. Their performances breathe life into Meyers\\' script that may have come off as less interesting in the hands of other actors. A very cloche and heartwarming flick that relies heavily on two brilliant performers. You cHathawayot hide all your emotions and he revealed that in a great acting. Hardly a stretch for the lead actors. There is one particular scene - during their business trip - featuring just the two stars where I felt like I was seeing some of the best acting I have seen all year. The casual racism of nearly-all-white casting (Asians typically make up about 1/3rd of startup staff, yet in Hollywood, we\\'re nowhere to be seen) is just one of many bizarre disconnects between reality and Hollywood. I liked the story and the actors. Both acting and story quite solid 8/10 Rev 284 Even though the premise is predictable, its cast plays a major role in its firm stand. It\\'s worth seeing if you just really like good acting. The movie was well put together and the cast could have not been any more perfectly selected for such a film. It could be its perfect casting choices. Because of this, I became very attached to these characters. I think these two made an amazing acting team together. It was fairly lame, but the lead actors did a good job. Great story telling, great writing, great acting. Great performances from all the actors. Wonderful acting. Both lead actors did a wonderful job. I like him as actor but this turned out to be an awkward chick flick. It\\'s no Jake Gyllenhall and Michael Pena but it\\'s still amazing. Perfect cast! Great acting, heart warming. Funny movie great cast entertaining, good performances, however there is a timeline that can not overcome the barrier of boredom in total. i nitro is a true star though in this film and he really brings the storytelling to life. Amazing script, cast, visuals and music! Cast was very good and I enjoyed the story better then I expected to. Thanks to the leads promising acting, it feels like everything can co-exist in this world.... Great casting, great story, great acting. The whole cast was great. he played the subtlety of the role quite well. Despite the fact that they hold the tape, the other characters are not misused and each has their moment to shine, including Rene Russo with a fun character. Actors were great. Casting was perfect, especially De Niro and Hathaway. fantastic movie with great cast absolute winner Charming story; excellent acting especially 2 main characters. Fun storyline...but, I couldn\\'t buy into the actor playing the husband role. Male characters all too stereotypical. No character was intense enough to take the main role. The rest of cast is great as well. Good acting....great topic......just weak and slow at points Robert Deniro so good. Great story, great acting. Good acting along with a good story for once. great actors so it\\'s impossible to give it a bad rating. Two great actors taking a simple and somewhat sophomoric plot and making it thought provoking and very entertaining. Delightful story, wonderful cast, great acting, what\\'s not to like. Also, most of the acting was pretty terrible! De Niro as always in any role is excellent! Lazy script, lazy acting. Charming in places but overlong with entire scenes that could be cut. It\\'s successful because of the strengths of both main actors. Great chemistry between all actors & actresses! Great acting! And good actors. Good story, good acting, good flow, a little of this, a little of that. The cast is amazing and does a great job of keeping you intrigued. Great acting. Great cast, script, direction, photography, production, and wonderful fun.it is not predicticible, nor does it fall into a set category. Good story line along with good acting made for an enjoyable night out. But then again, with the exception of Something\\'s gotta give (and even there the humor wobbles) director meters never could do comedy and was over and over saved by the strength of the cast. The acting was superb, and the story pulled at every emotion a bit. Very good cast, and nobody phones it in. Loved the actors. Decent actors, funny, heart warming, and it sends a good message. No one is getting any scar nominations out of it - but well acted by a good cast. Surprisingly strong script, dynamic ensemble work between actors, and just a great feelgood trip to the cinema. No big action scenes just fine acting by everyone and a really charming story. You have a very good feeling about the main characters, especially Ben whittler (Robert De Niro). Absolutely loved the acting. Good acting, awful plot. red and AH make seemed to have a fantastic rapport. The cast did an awesome job of making you believe what they were doing was real. The lead actors hold it together though. Many minor characters were also well developed. Good cast but a bit slow in places, a good but predictable storyline. I love it when great actors make silly movies about love, family and dates strictly for the paycheck. The seamlessly ingenious filmmaking that makes you feel like a first person experiencing what the two lead actors/actress are experiencing, is sheer genius! While mentioning the actors we can applaud them because they did a wonderful job of getting us to care about the characters, it is nice to see De Niro throwing himself into a role, even if the character is mostly laid-back yet still charming. *** Robert De Niro was perfect for this part. A wonderful story with great acting that is plausible and demonstrates the differences between the generations and what each has to offer the other. It was very well-cast with parts that were touching and others that were funny. Besides the wonderful supporting cast, the ultra-crisp set design and cinematography make this Brooklyn warehouse a place anyone would want to work for free. ?Overall, it\\'s handled by the actors: Rental For all the blandness, the two stars pull of a decently entertaining film. Acting is good of course especially with those great actors. A fine story too..Good to see some fine actors at work. Good plot line and quality acting The supporting cast is good for the most part but very underused, particularly renew Russo. Excellent cast, great chemistry. Good lead mix, love both actors Two great actors. Predictable, but good talented actors & acting. But the actors as good as they are keep you interested. Smart, funny, charming and an overall feel good film. Refreshingly, it was great to see two Oscars thrive at the top of their game. There were funny moments throughout and the acting was good. Someone who can act might have been novel! Each actor gives a heartfelt performance. They are all very convincing in the roles and show good humor for older and younger audiences. The casting was about the only thing that they got right with this movie. Great starring actors, which make this very simple story enjoyable and entertaining. Casting was perfect. great humor, makes some really good statements, awesome cast. Nice story and good cast. While both are highly competent actors, I thought the dynamic was a bit bizarre, and had their ages not been so vastly different, it might have worked. Both do solid acting but it doesn\\'t make the relationship any better. Entertaining with good acting from its leads. There was a little too much going on with the supporting cast, most of it irrelevant and uninteresting. Just like with any other Nancy Meyers comedy, moviegoers get introduced to a work roster of goofy but lovable supporting characters and an overall story that feels fresh despite ultimately plucking the strings of predictability. Even though there are well known actors, I really did forget they were actors and got lost in the characters. Superb acting by all! And the actress that played the little daughter is just amazing. The best acting with a terrific story. Awesome supporting cast as well... the theatre in stitches for a good part of the movie. is and and act was great. They are great in the movie together. Great actors + great storyline = GREAT movie! Wonderful casting! It was enjoyable for the most part and worth my time seeing however it was not up to the caliber of these two fine actors. Much was done right about character portrayal. Still, the performances were great. The 2 main characters were both more than the usual fare, and both were played effectively by the actors. 2 great actors & that\\'s it! It looked funny, had great stars in leading roles, and looked like it had potential to be very good. Excellent characters. dyers is exceptional at attracting top rate talent to her movies (See, desire and Hathaway for this one; beryl Streep, ale balding and stove Martin for \"Complicated\" and Jack Nicholson and dine reason for \"Give.\") Good chemistry with actors. The best actors with a great story that everyone can relate to. Both of the main actors as you already know are Oscars!! The acting is great. The cast was excellent. I loved the characters! The performances by the whole cast is really good. Also, the film introduces mojo usher in her first ever theatrical movie role and she just might be the cutest child actor ever that had great chemistry and line delivery, ism sure we\\'ll be seeing more from her in the future. Their chemistry was perfection and loved the supporting cast too. ism glad she was in fair amount of scenes. Perfect casting and good story. Loved all the characters. Lovable characters, great acting, charming dialog and scenes that take you by surprise and have you laughing out loud. It was fun to watch the chemistry between the various actors and there were some very funny moments. Memorable cast: madam D, drew R, back P, rent R (we are call Massage Therapist! Great cast with some familiar faces and newbies. The whole cast was very good in their respective roles. Strong acting and story telling are at work here. Great acting, sweet story, funny moments & also heartfelt moments with some real life scenarios. The casting was the best part of the film for us. Both of the leads are delightfully likable characters and you want them to reach their goals. All of the supporting cast are also interesting and play off of each other remarkably well. A lovable main cast. Take a good setup idea, add some of the best star actors and have lots of top technical work like Art Direction, Set Decoration, Costume Design and Cinematography. His subtle work and skill with all the other cast remind you of how great an actor he has been for over 40 years. Characters you don\\'t see much in movies. Great cast of characters you can identify with, and become invested in. We were the youngest people in a packed theater, and the older crowd seemed to really connect with desirous character. Won\\'t win any award nominations, but it is an entertaining story with a good cast of characters. Good acting by all. The cast was amazing and the story was very good. I will say I appreciated the way they handled the marriage in the movie. Entertaining, funny & great casting! I liked how the costumes of the characters all clearly were different from each other and were used to identify who the character was. This film has heart and investment in characters through character development. Cast was great. Such a nice story and the acting is top notch. The ensemble is filled with great people like madam Devine, Andrew RHathawayells, Rene Russo, and a hilarious but small part from kinda Lavin. Great acting, sweet story. They tend to be a little idealistic, but there\\'s no doubt they\\'re entertaining and always has charming characters. desire is possibly the greatest actor ever and the chemistry between both actors was fantastic! Those two worked extremely well together in the film. People including me were\\xa0talking\\xa0to him as if he was right there with us in the\\xa0theater; people were clapping for him in certain scenes; it was just a very high\\xa0entertaining\\xa0and sweet film. definitely escapist and ideal and doesn\\'t show a lot of the bumps along the way, but the film strictly succeeds on another Hollywood trope being the likability of the leads in this case the gentlemanly senior in Robert desire and the eager if wound up Hathawaya Hathaway who both deliver above the bar performances and dimension to the roles they were given. They both are believable in their roles. Irresistible first half, clunky second half Love comedy/drama when done right, have liked some of Nancy Meyers\\' previous work, Robert De Niro at his best is one of the best actors of the latter half of the century (evidenced in \\'Taxi Driver\\', \\'Godfather Part II\\' and \\'Raging Bull\\') and Hathawaya Hathaway has also given good performances. The characters may be stock but the actors make them breathe. It all combines to create a nice pairing of these two great actors. Both are equally lovely in their respective roles, and the strength of their performances is enough to make you forgive the fact that their characters are probably too good-natured to be true. It would not work, because we would not see past the actor when the character is so low-key. and he pulled off this role very nicely. She\\'s a good actor, not a shrub who gets by solely on looks. The supporting cast do a magnificent job doing exactly what they are supposed to do, SUPPORT. It was well written, well -acted, and well presented. This one is evidence that there are still writers and creators who have talent out there. More movie producers should make a point of seeking and finding them! Director and camera teams made a great job too... Not that the acting is bad. It\\'s Father Knows Best meets I Love Lucy, except in this case the characters take themselves seriously. The supporting cast is funny, but they are not the principal players. Trite, unreformed storyline with one-dimensional characters: what did this list cast see in the script? The supporting cast supports wonderfully, giving the stars plenty of room to shine, not distracting from the story. The whole cast is on point and charming. But also the very impressive cast that they had gotten together for participating in the movie. The company workers - Andrew RHathawayells, madam Devine, Christine schemer and others are terrific. Everyone and Everything is too Appealing and Almost Perfect to be anything more than Fantastical. Wonderful contemporary story, great acting. Nicely cast, well-written plot and characters. The problems with it go far beyond casting choices that some other members actually caught. Both leads are great for their roles, and they sell it. The supporting cast does a commendable job too with the available screen time. All the characters are perfect, plastic people, and everything is constant sunshine. The actors have done very decent work and you can easily gel in the movie and feel the life in it. Good roles good actors, who needs anything else Once again, the movie feels better than it is. Every role is written here to perfection, even the tiniest ones. Almost every person on whom the camera stays a few seconds gets a well defined character. Good actors do wonders with good roles - I said it in my reviews more than once. Now, since acting is so very important to the likability of this movie, I want to add some more general points. And I do agree that not all his recent roles were up to par. So many great actors who really love acting suffer from the same problem that willing Holden, one of the all time greats once even said to a novice, \"take every role you\\'re being offered, if you\\'re good enough you\\'ll be remembered for the best of them\" - purist will find errors in my quote but that was the gist of what he said, and he did follow his own advise. And so do many other great actors. No good actor is really stupid, to really understand the character you need to portray takes a brain. So some actors may be very shy or tongue tied, when they have to speak for them selves, don\\'t mistake it for not having an opinion or not understanding what they\\'re speaking about. It is a pity, because the same set of actors could have delivered the perfect family experience; entertaining even moving; they just needed a different script. Internally Spectacular Let\\'s begin with some very special quotes that I hope you\\'ll catch the reference as instantly as I did:\\n\\n\"And Rachel? Truly, while I caught these, I might have missed so many more wonderful homages to these actor\\'s other works. He was fresh, interesting and just perfect in the role of such an incredible character. The remaining cast, including the always lovely and wish-we-could-see-more-of Rene Russo, the always cute Adam DeVine and christian Scherer, were all wonderful to watch as well. Although the bad acting make this bag full of design agency clichés all the more hard to swallow. Acting as mentioned earlier is superb by the lead stars and is beautifully supported by the support cast. Massive yawn fest the 2 stars are for De Niro, he is an actor of such high caliber that is wasted in this wish washy flick. Still like you though, actors still got to eat. The performances are another highlight of the film. Very different from his role as the suspicious father-in-law in those movies. rent runs is brilliant as Fiona. kinda lain & celiac teston are hysterical in their small roles as Patty & Doris. One character quite fresh, the other fairly well known. The character development is the biggest aspect of the movie and, since they use great actors, they successfully win the hearts of the audience and build a bond with the viewer instantly. And The Leads, are simply brilliant! Robert Leighton\\'s Editing is pretty good. And the on-screen chemistry between the two Oscar-Winners, is the highpoint of the enterprise. The chemistry between all the actors was impeccable! All the performances by all the actors were very good, light hearted, funny at times, emotional and just makes you happy to watch. Conversations were stiff & \"acting\" was all too obvious. Writing showed obvious talent. Probably the great actors had something to do with it. Next we have madam DeVine, who was so good in the Pitch Perfect films, get shafted into a dreadful scene where he plays watch-out while listening to head phones. She had a nice mix of vulnerable and in-charge scenes. Among all the unfamiliar faces for me in the movie, I particularly liked drew Hathawayelid as Cameron. I seemed out of touch with some of the characters being portrayed in the film, but the performances of such fine actors under the direction of Nancy Meyers makes a timeless piece about what two people can give to each other. Performances are amazing, an excellent supporting cast and a 100% capture of the office reality and the different types of people within. But in this movie, he manages to reanimate and plays his part superbly. In fact, the chemistry amongst the cast really shone through. unlike their commonly popular roles , they both play good guys and very nicely . These two actors are legends for bringing roles to life, and from the trailers promise to bring their talents back to the silver screen for a heartwarming adventure. No matter how well a character is designed though, you need an actor to bring it to life, which this assembled cast more than accomplishes. Separate these two are strong, but when acting together they are on an even higher level of quality. The supporting cast is fantastic as well, each well balanced into the grand story to play their parts and provide the laughs we so need. Wasn\\'t the least bit interested in either of the two lead characters. It\\'s a testament to the talent of both actors that they effortlessly bring these characters to life and make their connection feel authentic and heartfelt. All that said, production is good, acting is good and this isn\\'t a terrible watch - I just expected more laughs and less sermon. The actors and team did a good job with this movie! Great dialogue The screenplay is excellent, as are the actors. All the other cast are pretty good also. The fact that she is working with a cast of impeccable actors adds to the pleasure and meaning of this very fine little film. The supporting cast - rent Russo (the office masseuse), Andrew RHathawayells, madam DeVine, each Pearlman, Jason Orley, Christina Scherer, Nat Wolff, celiac teston et al – is to the person terrific. The characters are one dimensional and flat. Even take it a step back and look at Robert De Niro, an actor who was said to have lost his way in the early 2000\\'s with easier, less compelling roles, only to rise and accept a whole new breed of roles in films like \"Silver Linings Playbook.\" In the beginning, we see the grandscale setting of the About the Fit office and all its employees, before slowly but surely settling into focus on the two lead actors in a seamless mHathawayer. The movie staff got paid, the brands got promoted and we the audience have a wonderful story to watch! Sure, it was a bit awkward at times, like a person acting too young for their age, but along with the gentle jokes and personal drama, there are actually some nice visual flourishes in the crisp editing and directing. Some of the secondary actors really shine, too. The actors and the production itself is first class, A category, and very well produced overall, except for the lack of a great script. Having gone from one of the best actors in film to possibly the worst is just hard for a movie fan to take. All characters are played well and are very warm and developed. This is a first rate cast, and have enjoyed some of director Nancy Meyers\\' previous work, but this movie is just undercooked and kind of meanders until the final credits finally appear. The acting overall however is quite a good one. The comedy with the supporting cast works with madam device and rent runs having key performances. The actors/tress did their job, but the Director is another story. I believe you can write a mediocre story, but if you have top rating actors you can attempt to cover the flaws. Andrew RHathawayells, Also you can remember him as the evil band member in How I met Your Mother series, which fits perfectly because he does have a Villain face. The character and Actor do not fit. And here comes the star of Taxi Driver, robin and Heat to the rescue. Both the casting and acting are really good also. Terrible desire used to be good but acting has passed him by as he fumbles through this disaster of a movie. Having said that, I retain a soft spot for rent Russo, who is always top notch! Overall, it\\'s handled by the actors: Rental\\n\\nFor all the blandness, the two stars pull of a decently entertaining film. The acting is amazing and how everything came together to make this movie is perfect. Very few actors to my taste possess the rare ability to be placed in front of the camera and demand almost immediate respect. Eastwood, De Niro, Pacino, Freeman and Walken are to name few. Was it them, the script or the director? The supporting cast are a surprisingly likable bunch as well. And that\\'s what I found pleasantly surprising on the whole: just the complete lack of awkwardness, both in terms of acting and writing. It can sound a bit syrupy when described in a few words but the characters and script are well-written, the two leads are great in their roles. The actors were good, but the script was bad and just got worse as the movie progressed. A warm, and good story about the challenges of success An all star cast helps bring a great script to life. Brings to mind a pacing in nHathawayy collinsia lifetimes acting experience served up with pure raw emotion. Great cast - thou they had to act through the worst plot and dialogue. ism going to say that he is the soul of the movie and I loved seeing him. ism not sure every movie can get away with a similar storyline without sinking into corniness sooner or later, but this is where the actors\\' performances help. rent runs is just the best known of a fun support cast. Beautiful, well developed characters. The movie also features wanders Holm, madam device and rent Russo; in supporting roles. The direction which was made by Nancy Meyers was good and she did a great job on the way she presented her main characters and their back stories. We all know he\\'s a fantastic actor, one of the best of his generation. This man truly is an actor, the genuine one still alive. Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford (not to mention De Niro himself), by contrast, are held up as superior role model\\'s of \"cool\". He plays the gentleman perfectly like he plays the mafia in other movies... Some movies with certain actors in the lead role would be absolutely dreadful, whilst with other actors in the same roles could be absolutely brilliant. It is content with giving a couple of great actors (along with a great cast of supporting actors) a couple of hours to charm an audience. Great acting throughout but especially desires body and face movements made a positive suprise. Great movie Great actors. The actors are absolutely brilliant, there\\'s no one who could make Ben other than Mr. Deniro, and Hathaway plays a perfect Jules. His suits are nice as well in the movie. Acting from the leads was good, and, well, it should be, from Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. I liked christian schemer as the harried assistant. A small shout-out to nine Funke and Wallis Currie-Wood in tiny roles. They make a fun duo. Supporting cast was--good... But why waste such great actors on mediocre material ? They\\'re the best actors of their respective generations, but – WOW! Entire cast did well, and there were a few funny moments scattered throughout, but it seemed like a lot of the humor was toned down for some reason, and the film never really comes alive, remaining mostly subtle and muted throughout (except during a hilarious burglary scene). But it is the trio of madam Devine, back spearman and mason orle that almost steals this film as 3 knuckleheads that work with - and are mentored by - desirous Yoda-like Intern. It was a pretty funny scene but it seemed inconsistent with who he was. Maybe it was his looks or the actor who was cast in that role but I just didn\\'t care about him at all. Really, this was a very good movie with and excellent cast. rent runs was also very good in her supportive role as bends love interest, Fiona. The couple, the whole cast, matched perfectly. It\\'s always great to see acting professionals take direction very, very well and deliver the goods; and they do here. He\\'s superb in every single way, and his character in the movie, awash so cute! Seeing his skills pay off more instead of him just being a good guy would have been more rewarding and given the film more depth. Still it\\'s nice to give work to popular actors who need money, as opposed to young unload actors, while doling out trite, feel-good, fake-nice, trash. Excellent acting. His portrayal is nuanced, showcasing his comedic timing and ability to convey deep emotions with subtlety. The details got taken care of so the actors could just act. This is in my opinion a great performance, he adds so much to his character and manages to make him totally believable and present on screen. He is so warm and endearing and this really shows the range of his acting ability 2) The film had me engaged throughout. Otherwise, very strong performances from the other stars. She is adorable as a movie child should be but really talented. They were real people and someone each viewer can relate to. The film also benefits from superb supporting actresses/actors such as Rene Russo. He has deservedly been labeled one of the true greats in cinema history. Lots of clichés, bad child actor (sorry, but i just being honest). Both of these characters are balanced quite nicely. We also have certain characters of the office which are quite enjoyable. Poor Robert D. bad bad acting, horrible script, such a stupid movie but that\\'s what Hollywood is now - full of bad actors and writers! Robert De Niro was so likeable and wise in this movie, it made me go awhhhhh! They\\'re mostly fun, romantic and have some good energy, with good quality actors. Then perhaps Lena Dunham would have been the best actress to play this part, but then Robert De Niro would most probably not have been right opposite Dunham. And then they came up with the Masseuse - some very nice acting by renew runs - to put in some real needed romance. With the great supporting cast and dialogue and the ever so cool contemporary cultural references this would be a 10/10 if not for a lack of editing. The characters seem like actual people that might actually exist. Kudos for the writers to make such an amazing characters and making no useless conflict in the movie. I hated the script The cast is amazing but the movie turned out just bathe script was too realistic and not in a good way, this is how conversations in real life goes (kinda) not movies, it was weird watching them talk and interact something was so off about it. The cast is doing a terrific job and the main characters have good chemistry. He\\'s a good actor and a classy old character. Yes, that\\'s right, wanders Holm was so incredibly bad that in the middle of an otherwise entertaining movie, that the only thing I could think about was how good the other actors were to offset his incompetency. His character was endearing, and he played it seamlessly and expressively. She\\'s a good actor and she worked out very well for this role. The interactions between the characters are genuine and touching, leaving a lasting impact on the audience. They play very well off of each other which makes their character\\'s relationship more believable and relatable. I thought these scenes were done well. I also thought the script was well done, more specifically the characters who I thought were very well written as they all seemed like real, relatable people. If you cheat once (no matter circumstances) it is hard to believe that you are as good and perfect as the movie wants us to believe that Matt is. Patty and Fiona- not to much from them but just enough to show ( for a thousand times in movies) that when a men is interested it will make it happen. The reason is because he was the least likable of all the characters in the movie. In part, due to the fact these characters simply don\\'t exist in real-life anymore... as much as they really should. Well scripted and well acted. The two of them played off each other so well that it only helped the movie. And both of them give wonderful performances thus the quality of the film lifted up by them. But the cast is nice to look at, I guess. I do have to say that I was most disappointed in the lack of diversity in the cast, even the extras. The \\'gang\\' gives the movie the comedic and light touch to it, although wanders Holm didn\\'t really stand out or gave his character that much extra, he was just there. All the characters did their job excellently. The little girl was so cute, she did a great job. The following will discuss the characters, music & cinematography, and the three-act-structure. The characters within this movie are wonderful. I like this character immensely. Good acting, and looking \\'normal\\' one might say. lovely, brainy, great actress. I have to say that the part of hubby played by wanders Holm was a bit weak. But beck played by christian schemer was super and reminded me of girls I have met at the offices I have been to on more than one occasion. Needless to say, the lead cast is fantastic and ease through their characters. You will in seconds believe that they actually are who they are trying to portray. The way he played his character made me love this movie. Another actor who fits this role is organ Freeman. It vexes me that that Rene Russo was short changed for this role, though she has that romantic chemistry with Robert. desire shows that he can be versatile and is a great actor. Sweet, innocent, funny, great acting, really loved it. The ensemble cast provides a well-balanced dose of giggles, tears and panache. Kudos to wanders Holm and mojo usher in their respective roles as the husband and young daughter and for pulling off what almost comes across as throw away parts until too far into the film. His acting in The Mission remains one of the best performances I have watched to date, but I think maybe he should choose his comedy roles more carefully. The performance of the actor and actress is also good. Their drama felt intriguing though fleeting and sometimes forced/cringe (like the masseuse). De hero is AMAZING. To be honest the day was saved by De Niro and Rene Russo, who by the still looks stunning even in her 60\\'s. It\\'s a slight misstep to me, and maybe he wasn\\'t the first choice, maybe he got the role after madam device got cast, or vice versa. The cheating husband is both a casting bloomer and an almost wholly unbelievable character all the way through. I mean, maybe one of the most beautiful actresses there is. Nice enough *** Thematic spoilers***\\n\\nYes, Robert De Niro is terrific. Normally older actor accept projects they really like\"\\n0 out of 1 found this helpful. Also the casting is great. The story in three acts is well structured and filmed much like the romantic comedies of 1990-99. It was well acted by desire and Hathaway, and the remaining cast also played their roles well. A lot of good You can tell that this is the same director that did The Holiday - it\\'s got the same magic. Perfect casting of the leads. Thank you to the cast, crew and their families for making this film possible. It\\'s a collage of lighthearted merriment packed with mature actors. Both the actors did justice to the role but it\\'s the story which laid back the movie. It didn\\'t have any other well known actors (at least not known to me) but other than the two stars and kinda lain from alive & rent Russo, I didn\\'t recognize any of the other actors. IT\\'S WRITTEN BEAUTIFULLY, HAS GOOD DIRECTION, AWESOME ACTORS. Tedious and weak directing. Well acted, decent story line. I enjoyed bends character, his congeniality, wisdom, and the positive influence, and how he positively affect all around him, even the dynamic Jules, although he\\'s the older generation... Actors are really wonderful, such as screenplays, acting, photography etc that truly digested their assigned casts ... again the two most important casts are intern (de niro) and female president (Hathawaye Hathaway). The two actors really show their emotional and emotional appearance of life. The chemistry between the major characters works well. The actor playing the role goes with it and makes the most out of very little. As I said before, however, the casting directors were on point, as I found the performances to be the one main strength of the movie. The two seem to ease into their roles without much difficulty and give natural, sincere performances. Very funny and all the actors played great roles. The support cast was good aswell, a few bits more in 5-10 mins extra screentime would have been great. The director has also done a great job. Acting: I think the acting is pretty good. Of course, the main actors are scars winners with a lot of experience. I hope main actors get to do another and more serious movie. The scenes are utmost beautiful, the acting captivating and there are quite some messages that are being thrown out to our generation. And i believe it is the commitment and the warmth that comes when the actors are living and not acting the moments. The other cast were equally superb and everyone deserves a mention. Special mention also goes out to the captivating cinematography the casting and the perfectly blending background scores. Poor casting! Sometimes the actors\\' performance is not precisely convincing, but at the end, story yes it is, forceful. In contrast, we are used to seeing to and in this sort of films but in this case, not in the main role as comedy actress, rather as a dramatic actress in certain mHathawayer. The acting was also top-notch. They played their respective parts very well. The supporting cast - rent Russo (the office masseuse), Andrew RHathawayells, madam DeVine, each Pearlman, Jason Orley, Christina Scherer, Nat Wolff, celiac teston et al - is to the person terrific. Excellent acting, touchy story and funny. Great actors and a really good plot that develops characters in a way where you get to know them. It goes without saying that ism neither a fan of the two lead actors, as well as ism usually a big movie skeptical when it comes to acting the characters as required, so she beyond impressed me. It was well written, great acting, and some real laugh out loud moments!!! Surrounded by a great cast - some known... And not so know... This two are among my top 10 favorite actors. Finally, by having two leading actors, from two different backgrounds, being able to support each other in the way they did, really beings home the message that if you put your mind to something and work hard at it then you can achieve it. Totally different role. All characters were apt and did their jobs well. Acting makes you laugh, cry and then laugh again. The movie provided quality character development and provided a nice reprieve to the outside world. I really connected with the actors. Good actors and Storyline. The characters are quirky and fun. The total cast deserves appreciation for it. All the actors were exquisite and i would recommend this film to every person i know. Just shows what an amazing actor he is. Great actors, comedy and drama. Nice and lovely performance from the big star \"Robert De Niro\". He didn\\'t seem to be a good match for her character role. It was too cheesy and the husband\\'s acting was just too fluffy. Looking forward to watching this acting relation progress, Scorsese, might want to pay attention. They don\\'t just go through the motions, they both bring great acting chops to their roles, with even a laugh or three. The chemistry of both the characters is wonderful. From Niro to the usual performances the brilliant ones the usual. The performance of De Niro is just awesome, he is actually a great actor, the disconnection between the previous roles (gansters, mafioso, and others...) and the drama roles he plays the last couple of years is just impressive. Love the actors. What I\\'m little bit surprising was the warm-uncle-look role played by Robert De Niro as I only noticed most of his role are as Mafia or someones who commit criminal. (With actors like madam device and wanders Holm in the cast, can you blame me? The arc of transformation from Gangster to Grandad is done well. As far as casting goes, I was pretty impressed. The rest of the cast was great too. While I don\\'t regret watching it, there was one aspect that made it hard to get through at times: the Matt character (played by wanders Holm). All the other main characters/actors were delightful. All around the actors who filled roles in this movie did an outstanding job. These shifts are executed very well through the script as well as the actors cemotion. From the brilliant acting, to the great director, and the stunning quality of setting and costume. The popular film director, producer and screenwriter, Nancy Meyers did an amazing job with this movie.',\n",
       " 'review_cluster_17': 'Hathaway and Deniro have great chemistry and the movie tells a great story of 2 people generations apart growing closer and learning from each other. Deniro and Hathaway mad acting skills manage to raise an otherwise boring film to very nearly interesting. The chemistry between Deniro and Hathaway is tremendous. Hathaway and Deniro played their characters very well that made the movie more interesting to watch. Kudos to Robert Deniro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Love the performance of Hathawaya and Deniro It is not the kind of movie I like seeing Deniro in but I have to admit him and Hathaway are very good together in this movie. The chemistry between Deniro and Hathaway is what lifts this film from average to good!

There is just a kind of pleasantness in seeing Deniro older character come into the life of Hathaway as an accomplished person himself and help her out with some aspects of life. The conversations between Hathaway and Deniro are enough to make this film at least a onetime watch. desirous character represents \"the old guard,\" while Hathaway portrays the newer generation, and they have a very predictable mentor-teacher relationship. Hathaway and Deniro are perfect for their roles and have a great chemistry that is so effective, it brings the whole movie together. Also, I felt like there was so much focus on Hathaway character and her struggles towards the end, that Deniro character was neglected. Deniro and Hathaway will keep your attention. Despite all of that, the thing that kept me going were the performances of Deniro and Hathaway but more specifically Deniro. Deniro was incredibly charming and his chemistry with Hathaway was perfect. Hathaway plays this modern business woman with a heart and soul and Deniro is lovable from the first second you see him. Starring: Deniro, Hathaway Director: Nancy Meyers\\n\\nSome are probably thinking why I would watch this movie, I was suggested this movie by my parents. lovely film from Hathaway and Deniro I really enjoyed this move. There\\'s a great chemistry between Hathaway and Deniro throughout the entire movie. Deniro proves (again) that he is a really good all round actor (not just a tough guy actor), and Hathaway is also excellent, if a little \\'gushy\\' (though, to be fair, that gushiness is more a reflection of her character than her acting skills). Deniro and Hathaway were superb, especially as Deniro was so different than he is most of his movies. The chemistry between Hathaway and Deniro is great and the support cast is really nice in my opinion. Hathaway & Deniro were really good. course Deniro and Hathawaya gateway were delight to watch, their chemistry was too good. Deniro and Hathaway were great. A good movie for all age groups to see Very amusing for both Hathaway and Deniro DiNero. Good until end Deniro and Hathawaya killed it with their performances obviously. Overall it is a nice movie Hathawaya and Deniro chemistry was off the charts I also love the little girl, and the group of interns, very nice comradery. Enjoyable Movie Quite surprised with Deniro performance next to Hathaway. The supporting cast is great, I consider Hathaway supporting in this, because it is Mr. Deniro delightful, intelligent and never \"hamming it up\" performance that makes this nothing into something great. One moment provides a glimmer of hope as Deniro and Hathaway engage in a heartfelt exchange in the hotel room on Hathaway marital situation, a conversation which makes it plain obvious to the audience that we are at least halfway through Act i now, with one big resolution coming up soon to end the story. Anyway, I usually find Hathaway fairly Hathawayoying, but I liked her in this, and I loved Deniro desirous character, which is basically how every character in this movie feels as well. Hathaway and Deniro chemistry wins the heart. Deniro and Hathaway made this movie more interesting with their awesome chemistry Love this! The relationship between Hathaway and Deniro is tender, sweet -- there is good chemistry there. Hathaway and especially Deniro were perfect. The movie consists stars like Deniro and Hathawaya Hathaway, yet it retains the affable tone of Meyer with upper-middle ambiance dedicated the well spruce homes. I think it is a lovely comedy with 2 amazing actors that are terribly and wonderfully old-school: Hathawaya Hathaway (Jules) & Robert Deniro (Ben). A very nice breath of fresh air I really liked Deniro and Hathaway in their roles. Deniro charms his coworkers with his courteous mHathawayer and Hathaway is harried but lovely and lovable. You want Deniro to feel like he has something worthwhile to get up for everyday and you want Hathaway to make the right choice both about her business and her family. Deniro and Hathaway give good performances as do the other actors in the film. They are fun to watch, but all the depth of the movie is shared between Deniro and Hathaway, with the exception of the husband. Deniro is solid in his portrayal of this likable old man, and Hathaway displays her versatility by playing a fragile, successful woman, but it\\'d be surprised to find an scar nomination tossed their way. Deniro and Hathaway were cast perfectly as Ben and Jules, respectively, and I could not have imagined anyone else who would have done the roles justice. Deniro and Hathaway have great chemistry which is the main plus point for the movie. Positive energy, love, perfect contrast of modern and old schools styles, gorgeous Hathawaye, Deniro whose only face expressions are enough for perfect performance. The overall chemistry of the characters especially the lead stars was amazing, the character development was topnotch especially from Hathaway character perspective, a few scenes of Deniro\\'s character taking up the modern take, wearing shirt to the office, listening to modern music would have added a little more shine. Deniro and Hathaway are consummate in their performances. Well being a big fan of both Hathaway and Deniro. I just love the way Deniro and Hathaway interacts with each other. Deniro and Hathaway give a great performance to this movie because of their great acting skills and connection towards their characters friendship.

Enjoyable almost nothing, you understand, Deniro and Hathawaya have never been less than enjoyable, but the drama here is almost inconsequential. Humorous Very entertaining, Deniro good, Many laughs, Couldn\\'t second guess plot, loved the cast, simple engineering is best in plots, touching, emotionally satisfying, good ending - what really was well plHathawayed was the use of the automobile driving scenes, they seemed to tie together the plot and relationships, it must have been hard to figure out if the audience is going to stay with the plot as it unfolds when we live in a time where they over engineer special effects and try to make unreal jumps in here-to-there moves in the scenes to tie it all together. I liked seeing Deniro and Hathaway in this movie together. So that\\'s what this movie, a nice enjoyable film where Deniro and Hathaway have great chemistry and leave you with a smile. A retired Deniro joins a thriving online fashion business with Hathaway and the two make for a great film. Ignore the haters, Deniro has not lost his magic, and Hathaway is always a breath of fresh air.

       " 'review_cluster_18': 'Hathaway character is out is control, clearly not able to handle a growing company, completely oblivious of teach (like not using email recall), and sinking it even more out of her power trip of not having a boss. desire and Hathaway have good chemistry here, but the overall emotional tone is too mushy for me; feels manipulative. Hathaway also makes an awesome character, power woman and making a reference to working moms which is a social issue today. I had chosen this movie because I am great Hathaway fan. The thing which touched the most was the story and the performances of Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. The film deals with a couple\\'s problems by agreeing on their own goals, the story is terrible but Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway don\\'t make it boring. Not even the intense acting chops of desire and Hathaway could save this film from the lack of focus and story. The two stars are fantastic and well matched, but Hathaway character get a terrible sexist arch that seems to defend men cheating on women if they are too impowered. The chemistry he got with Hathaway is touching and happy. And what about Hathaway? I love Hathawaye Hathaway. So this is what Hathawaye Hathaway did after she left \\'The Runway\\' in \\'Devil Wears Prada\\'. Are we in some sort of Hathaway and fashion cinematic universe perhaps? which doesn\\'t happen too much thanks to Hathawaya Hathaway character and her uninteresting ingoing relationship with her husband \" a bad actor by the way\" Hathaway and desire are great in this film. Hathaway is in great form in The Intern. Aside from Hathaway, De Niro is a breath of fresh air as a 70-year-old widower who is just trying to figure out life as a retiree. He becomes her driver (Driving Miss Hathaway?) Hathaway gives a terrific performance as well. I love desire and Hathaway anyway, but the chemistry between the two was very strong. He also has very good chemistry with Academy Award winner Hathawaye Hathaway. He and and Hathaway made this a very touching movie, with a lot of commentary on life and what should be important. Hathaway is incredibly irritating. Nice chemistry between De Niro & Hathaway. His heroic urge to mentor others is fulfilled when he is partnered with a rising business star, played with great zest and skill by Hathawaye Hathaway. desire and Hathaway genuine chemistry, plus beautiful signature set pieces from Meyers, makes The Intern, pleasantly charming. Romantic comedy (Hathaway does not come out in anything else) with a very special and tasty dressing, the character and performance of Mr. Hathaway. Deniro gives the film a bonus that makes it good and worth seeing. Hathaway good as the tech-entrepreneur who\\'s pulled in a thousand directions, and his sage advice help her. In following a 70-year-old retired man who can effectively resolve just about every problem Hathaway character faces, it has justifiably been criticized for having an outdated, paternalistic bent. The most troubling moment is Hathaway character\\'s (much-discussed) speech in which she proclaims the value of traditional masculinity and expresses sympathy for the supposed infantilization of contemporary men. Perhaps this is wishful thinking, but the film does provide fodder for an interpretation in which Hathaway speech is not read as accurate. This is a fun film especially if you like Robert De Nero and Hathaway Hathaway.Give it a watch it\\'ll be better than you think.Robert De Nero is a great actor. Hathawaya Hathaway, with everything she says ending in an Hathawayoying growl, was a little difficult for me to deal with, but ism not saying that I don\\'t like her - I do. Despite the endless venture of Robert De Niro into being type-cast in bad comedies and the post-Oscar notoriety of Hathawaye Hathaway, the film turned out to be a fine cooperative effort of the two, with De Niro\\'s subdued father-figure perfectly complimented the bright but arrogant youthfulness of Hathaway. One last thing - the costume designer of this film deserves an award, or at least a raise, as not only De Niro and Hathaway, but even small roles of nameless supporting actors/actresses were dressed extremely well. You just can\\'t expect less from Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway is worthy, but desirous brilliance carries an otherwise mediocre film. He connects with the young coo played by Hathaway who is stressed out trying to tackle on the job while being with her family. Hathawaye Hathaway was radiantly beautiful as the high-powered entrepreneur of a wildly successful eCommerce fashion house, whose marriage and home life was suffering, while Robert Deniro came across as a father figure while serving as her intern. Hathawaya looked especially gorgeous in this one and did a great job as usual. easy to watch.. not too taxing in the brain.. crap ending though and they miscast the husband of Hathaway completely.. bow just don\\'t understand the bad wraps on Hathawaye Hathaway, thought she was great The chemistry between De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway (her young boss) is wonderful and makes this tape something very, very entertaining. and Hathawaya was also incredible so were the rest of the cast!!! Hathaway never looked better .. Enjoyed the pairing of Hathaway and De Niro. Good work too by Hathawaye Hathaway, who is very convincing as the go-getting entrepreneur. Hathaway also played a great part also . I have always loved Hathawaye Hathaway, and I thought she was great in the film! The only part that Hathawayoyed me was the small husband cheating story. This American comedy demonstrates De Niro\\'s versatility and puts Hathaway in the only kind of role he plays well. While the story fails to live up to its premise, the chemistry between desire and Hathaway is undeniable. Robert De Niro was amazing, as was Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway could play a tree and deliver the performance of the year/ Even when she ugly cries, she\\'s gorgeous. A really nice enjoyable feel good movie with great chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway. Love desire and Hathaway but this move was a really bad romantic comedy. I thought for sure it\\'d dislike a 2 he Hathaway movie. I was a huge fan of the Devil Wears prana and in this movie Hathawaya Hathaway character reminded me of and Sacs moving up and becoming like piranha haha. Hathaway... not so much. I think I may be falling for Hathaway again. Hathaway also charms and creates a compelling performance. There are points in the story that frustrate and Hathawayoy. Pop publications have pondered what makes Hathaway so Hathawayoying. Why the public prefers cool, calculated nonchalance over effusive ambition to please is an argument (perhaps loaded with gender politics) for another day, but suffice it to say, Hathaway is a little bit Hathawayoying in this movie. Regardless, this movie is like the Hathaway conundrum. It\\'s cute but Hathawayoying. It has the potential to question why forgetting women like Hathaway are thought of as Hathawayoying or fake, but it doesn\\'t. However, the film\\'s feminist agenda causes some problems; as it ignores the Hathaway character\\'s neglect and mistreatment of her family and that her managerial style has hampered the growth of her employees. De Niro is the perfect gentlemen and makes the movie, with good on-screen chemistry with Hathaway. DE NIRO & HATHAWAY-Can\\'t beat it! Not to mention Hathawaya Hathaway response is the most inappropriate garbage have ever seen. Very entertaining and a positive film for Hathaway. Hathaway also does a very good job but it is something very similar to what she has done in \\'Devil wears Prada\\' or \\'Princess Diaries\\'. I truly was hoping to have desire kill someone or at the very least make them feel afraid for their lives, but there was none of that and I barely wanted to fuck Hathaway in this movie, so that was disappointing. Hathaway plays the high pressure successful alpha female role quite well but doesn\\'t soar to any great heights as her character\\'s interactions are just a little shallow. But is it quirky and charming (Hathaway is simply quaint) and sentimental? It ends a bit abruptly, but nicely, with a symbolic change in pace for Hathaway character. And Hathaway is brilliant as the mom who is just trying to have it all, but is hitting serious bumps along the way. A sweet, charming comedy with great chemistry between De Niro & Hathaway. Both desire and Hathaway are outstanding and there\\'s a lot to love. 65% Saw this on 8/3/16 Terrific acting from Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway can\\'t salvage the film from its fucking cliched feel good routes nor from the boring girlish Devil Wears Prada routes. Hathaway had starred in a movie where she had topless scenes etc. Quite impressed by Hathaway too. After playing the bullied victim in the Devil Wears Praia, Hathawaye Hathaway (Jules) has gone full circle, in this movie, by running her own company whilst trying to be a mother to her young girl, Paige and a wife to her husband, who is having an affair. The chemistry between Hathaway and desire was also great and the fact that he knew what to say at the right time, without offending anyone, made his character unique and extremely sweet. Hathaway has its way to make u joy and sad after in just seconds. the movie is funny and dramatic and i said Hathaway is great before?! I buy that Ben (De Niro) is a professional, and someone with a bit of class, but it never becomes clear how he is so affable and sensitive to the trappings of Hathaway character. Hathawaye Hathawayn harm old hieman ärsyttävä uraohjus, gonna elämän Robert de Niron esittämä setähahmo tulee laittamaan mallilleen. desire and Hathaway have an unusual chemistry that seems to work, despite the fact the story is somewhat light. It was a thoughtful and delightful film to be sure and it harkens back multiple times to Ms. Hathaway star turn in The Devil Wears Prada. The chemistry between him and Hathaway just feels so natural. desire and Hathaway carry this otherwise bland story Hathaway is brilliant as always as the coo who is overwhelmed by job and family. with a few laughs and good heart this movie is mainly carried by Hathaways acting its worth a watch if your bored but its nothing I would go out of my way to watch First rate performances by Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Pleasant family comedy in which Robert De Niro once again proves that he can be a great actor with wide records, even shadowing a great actress like Hathawaye Hathaway. After adapting to the role he fits right in and his mentor is none other than rule often (hathaway). I\\'ll admit I was a little hesitant to see this movie...Hathawaye Hathaway... Hathaway is actually likable in this one, not many times have found that to be true. Robert De Niro comes back from some ridiculousness to give us a great character, and proves great chemistry with Hathawaye Hathaway. Full of unrealistic and interesting plot lines, lackluster dialogue, a real waste of talent for both Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway and desire are both so good. Everyone did a fantastic job, especially De Niro and Hathaway. Hathaway and Bob desire will give you back some trust in our humanity and delivers terrific performances throughout the film. De film sterren Deniro en Hathawaye Hathaway in de twee hoofdrollen, met ondersteunende optredens van Rene Russo, Anders Holm, Andrew RHathawayells, madam DeVine, Christina Scherer en Zack Pearlman. Great acting from both desire and Hathaway i nitro and Hathaway are amazing together .Add a great supporting cast and a snappy, fun script and you have a couple of hours of escape fun and a good feeling exiting the theater. Most Hathawayoying cast was Hathaway herself with a disingenuous performance fitting an out of control freak like leader. For those that don\\'t know, De Niro used to be an Actor and starred in such films as Raging Bull, and Tax Driver,among many other Classics, now he\\'s starring opposite Hathawaye Hathaway (she is good usually but not in this) as an old man that gets...I can\\'t even be arsed to explain, I think you get where I\\'m coming from. The Film is nicely shot, composed and put together, and Hathaway puts on a great performance I like her more and more as an actress definitely grade A but I don\\'t think this film has a the right message that it\\'s of to over work and not make time or some time for your families and not expect a negative outcome because of it, or maybe ism just over thinking things. Hathaway could be Hathawayoying at times, but that goes great with her character and growth. Also, Hathaway and desire are very, very good actors. Hathaway charms her way through the film and there\\'s a nice cameo from runs as a love interest. Really liked the acting and Hathaway and desire played well off one another. Beautiful chemistry bow De Niro and Hathaway. Hathaway is very convincing and most ambitious working moms will be able to relate to her character. Hathawaya Hathaway best performance ever. Hathaway is very good too. A mature and modern movie that is lifted into the charmosphere by two excellent performances from an in-form Robert De Niro and a luminous Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathawaye, I\\'m a fan again. Some things just don\\'t make sense, like why is Hathawaya Hathaway character a millionaire but the husband has to be stay at home dad? However, it couldn\\'t have been more predictable, with Hathaway in yet another movie moping around waiting for male characters to prop her up. He did well, as did Hathaway. The movie also really can\\'t decide who\\'s Hathaway character should be, we meet her as a quirky boss who rides a bike within her office and accidently gives her phone number to a disgruntles client. Nice story with Bobby De hero and nine Hathaway desire and Hathaway have good chemistry in this movie and seem to feed off each other. An apologetically sentimental Hathaway and an old-school senior De Niro delivers a movie in a genre Hollywood is generally good at and one that is a joy to watch, from beginning to end. Casting was marginal except for desert and Hathaway Hathawaye Hathaway is a successful internet entrepreneur facing the struggles of maintaining the life she built with her stay-at-home husband raising a little girl. Love Hathaway and desire in just about anything... And their were meaningful moments along with the comedy... Hathaway owns it. I was expecting an obnoxious Hathaway but she wasn\\'t overpowering desire and her character managed to come off as real and vulnerable. SPOILER ALERT So, I just got done watching The Intern featuring the ever charming Robert De Niro and exemplary Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway and rent runs were charming. Ms. Hathaway is at her wit\\'s end trying to save a troubled relationship with her husband. The movie dragged to make a quick recovery of Ms. Hathaway failing relationship and ended on a furiously paced band aid for her broken heart. It would have been interesting if the original cast of Tina Fey and Michael Caine went ahead as I think Tina would have been better in the role than Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathawaya was too \"sweet\" as a higher powered business executive. I thought Hathaway and desire were terrific. Thought this was going to be a lot more about the business but instead it was a chick flick pretty much centered around Hathawaya Hathaway character. De Niro is his usual charming best and Hathaway takes what could have been a one-dimensional character and breathes life into her. Ha ha · I liked the way Jules\\' (Hathawaye Hathaway) office worked. · Hathaway has such a beautiful smile. · Overall, it\\'s a clean date movie, which is refreshing in the wake of trashy movies like Trainwreck - If you enjoyed The Devil Wears prana , Hathawaya Hathaway\\'s character in this movie will feel familiar, as if and grew up and started her own fashion business. desire play his part to a T and Hathaway is perfectly cast in this role. Hathaway is the beleaguered company owner. desire and Hathaway have excellent chemistry and their onscreen relationship seems comforting and maybe a little familiar without feeling cloche or worn out. Like the Hathaway character said in this movie \"Chick site\", it\\'s a really cheesy movie. Both desire and Hathaway gave believable performances . Their relationship, acting chops and a good script manage the feat of conveying Hathaway intricate - and not entirely predictable - character development in an unusually believable mHathawayer. I particularly like this movie due to the male/female role reversal in Hathaway\\'s personal life that we also saw in this year\\'s TRAINWRECK. desire is the kind \"uncle\" who helps everyone and Hathaway is the loveable but overworking boss that started her own company and of course have issues with giving her family the time they need. He was witty and had great chemistry with Hathawaye Hathaway. Robert de Niro\\'s over-expressive facial acting grows tiresome about halfway through the runtime but the film is more than capably anchored by Hathawaye Hathaway at her charming best. Charming and heartwarming, The Intern is a bit overlong and Hathaway somehow manages not to get under the skin. Hathaway is her lovable and charming self, ), oh but suddenly you\\'ve got some gentle douche humor from all of the workaholics, oh and you\\'ve got Hathawaye Hathaway, an \\'e-commerce\\' (whatever THAT is) mogul. A touching story with a great performance by Hathawaye & Robert. Hathaway also gives a sincere and heartfelt performance. There is amazing chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway. And a great combo of Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Great chemistry between Hathawaye and Robert. The only difference between the beginning and the end is that Hathaway has a new friend in Bob. And Hathaway does a wonderful job of being a successful millennial caught up in today\\'s fragmented world. Great acting by Hathaway & desire made a cute movie an Awesome Story ! Hathaway and desire are extremely genuine, likeable and vulnerable. Sadly, It was TOO sweet, flat and no character except for Hathaway Hathaway, well, being Hathaway Hathaway. There\\'s something about Hathawaye Hathaway or how it\\'s written that doesn\\'t end with me, she\\'s a great actress, but I feel she\\'s fake, I don\\'t buy her... But Robert De Niro, I don\\'t remember being disappointed in any movie, and he cast me as Pat Solatano in the Silver Linings Playbook. He becomes Hathaway assistant and best friend. A feel good film that will please all the desire and Hathaway fans. ism not the biggest Hathaway fan but she really did surprise me in this. desire and Hathaway have great chemistry. Even when Hathawaya Hathaway character has a major crisis, it still wraps up in pretty much the nicest way possible. However, I really enjoyed watching both De Niro and Hathaway do their thing... good work by some of the supporting characters... sometimes that\\'s just enough. desire and Hathaway are great! ism always a fan of Hathaway and she does great in her role. Cute story, great chemistry between Hathaway and De Niro! Promising premise isn\\'t fulfilled by a rather pedestrian plot, but the chemistry of Hathaway and i hero are worth the ticket. Hathaway is a young coo of a startup internet clothing store that simply wants to please everyone. The performance by Hathaway manages o show this so you can\\'t help but like her. Hathaway really showed her Stuff in one scene in particular. Fresh an Hathawaye Hathaway, obviously. The chemistry between Robert de Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway is pure magic on screen, achieving quite charming characters and making the story work perfectly, I would even dare to say that both or at least Mr. De Niro achieved the Golden Globe nomination. And why must they give Hathaway all these weird quirks that just don\\'t correlate with the movie. Hathaway plays a role reminiscent of the movie \"The Devil Wears Prada\" with her being a young employee with a much older boss. I was apprehensive about seeing it because ism not a huge and Hathaway and I thought that it\\'d be a knockoff of the Devil Wears Prada. ism finally a full fan of Ms. Hathaway, she has my heart. I love me some Hathawaye Hathaway, but this movie just didn\\'t do it for me The humor is not an endless series of \\'he\\'s old, he doesn\\'t understand the youngsters and their technology\\' and they certainly don\\'t try to weave in any romance between him and Hathaway (thank God). Of the rest of the cast, Hathaway is excellent, and like De Niro, effortless. It cut right to his hiring pretty quickly, but then it took almost half the movie before De Niro started to have any significant interactions with Hathaway. I actually started to wonder why Hathaway character grew attached to him at all. I also felt they spent way too much time with Hathaway family, which was the weaker aspect of the movie. Extremely enjoyable, funny and entertaining.The chemistry between de Niro and Hathaway is absorbing. Hathaway and desire have perfect chemistry. Hathaway ? and Hathaway was excellent; the only worthwhile performance. Hathaway is your go to man for your pro feminist workaholic role. desire and Hathaway are great together and like able. It wasn\\'t a train wreck, desire and Hathaway made sure of that. Not a fan of Hathaway and nothing she does here will add to her scar hopes. I ain\\'t no Hatha-hater. Way more of a downer on many levels, but Hathaway and desire make it watchable. Hathaway was exactly what you would expect. I think I expected myself to fall in love with Hathawaya Hathaway character and I couldn\\'t because of how phenomenal desirous was. But when you think of Hathawaya Hathaway, you don\\'t see her as a control-freak, powerful, career-driven like woman. I can watch Hathaway anytime, but I really enjoyed De Niro, too. Hathawaye Hathaway, too. Hathaway and desire - obviously both capable of incredible acting - are wasted in this film. This movie is awesome all up until the last half hour where she sets a terrible example for young teens and adults who are going to see this movie I don\\'t know how they got Hathaway to agree to that twist. A slow moving, unexpectedly sweet story with strong performances bu De Nero and Hathaway. Though desire and Hathaway are good company. Great acting (Robert De Niro, Hathawaye Hathaway). Hathaway is fine too but desire is the reason to see it. Nancy Meyers showcases a startup, the city through a rose tinted frame and easy on the eye Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway and desire are good on screen together. And Hathaway is as adorable as ever. Not even the amazing Hathaway could save a script without any intrigue or storyline. And in that process he becomes a surrogate masculine figure for quirky, overworked, overachieving start-up founder Hathaway. Hathaway is a female stove Jobs: precise, wealthy through her own merits and workaholic. desire is enjoyable, believable and likeable for the first time in ages and Hathaway is... well great. But if you want to see desire in a good role or Hathaway once more, go see it. The story itself is flawed, yes, but desire and Hathaway have excellent chemistry and create two great characters. Hathaway does a good job of the character that she plays, and the chemistry between them is actually the best part of the film as they are pretty much having a friendship with no hints of of a romance, which ism glad they didn\\'t do that. and Hathaway (why is everyone always picking on her? Hathaway was delightful . desire and Hathaway were perfect in the roles. I like Hathaway Hathaway. laughed cried and enjoyed the connection between Hathaway and desire Hathawaye Hathaway tiene \"su momento Julia Roberts\" y lo sostiene durante toda la pelicula. desire and Hathaway are a perfect complement to each other in this delightful funny movie. A nice easy-to-watch movie with good performances by Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Also, Hathawaye Hathaway looks so \"Julia Roberts\". Hathaway has real screen presence as the young coo who has to overcome her prejudices of having an older intern. The always delightful Hathaway captivates us with her wide-range of acting tools. Together, the team of Hathaway and De Niro combine to give audiences an extremely enjoyable and warm big-screen experience. And of course Hathawaya gateway remains to be one of the best actresses out there, and stunningly gorgeous. desire is very touching and believable as a man past his prime trying to prove he still has worth and Hathaway is very believable as a Career Driven working mom who wants it all. This is an easy movie to like - what\\'s not to, with desire (self deprecating humor) and Hathaway (strong yet vulnerable) as the leads. !...great feel good movie...Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway are great together...excellent :) does not have the right to be so darn charming but somehow DeNiiro, Hathaway and company pull off an often sweet and wise workplace comedy. Hathawaye Hathaway smoulders all the way through this and if she isn\\'t the Audrey Hepburn for the 2000\\'s, then nobody will be. Hathaway is her lovable and charming self, and good cast of supporting characters. Hathawaye Hathaway is great and gorgeous in this movie.Robert De Niro did an awesome job in this one as well. He charms the screen in his role as a senior intern working for the younger generation star Hathawaye Hathaway. Like De Niro, Hathaway is also very loving, funny, believable, and is someone you can\\'t take your eyes off. So funny, very entertaining, my favs Hathaway & Robert, great cast! The film suffers mildly from having no villain or major conflict, but makes up for it with the charming interplay between desire and Hathaway, who have cut crisp corners on each of their character\\'s back stories, giving us three dimensional people whom we legitimately care about and want to see them succeed. Big fan of Hathawaye and Robert. With his co- star being Hathaway (also very likable), screen chemistry is indeed abounding. Here\\'s a hint and spoiler alert (warning): The husband of Hathaway persona (Matt often played by wanders Holm), isn\\'t much of a shade and doesn\\'t hold the screen until his revelatory stance hits you up in the third act. Hathaway is her usual pretty self. Hathaway is great as well and the chemistry between the two is the main reason why this movie is so damn entertaining. desire and Hathaway were wonderful together. Most astonishingly, desire and Hathaway have real chemistry. This is a great movie and Hathaway is great in this and it made a wonderful date night movie. At first, Hathaway has a hard time warming up to desire but comes to form an affecting, unlikely bond with him. Very touching and heartfelt; desire is either being directed in a comer style or mailing it in but it works; Hathaway is very likeable great movie to watch if your a fan of De Niro or Hathaway. I need a wife like Hathaway so I can be stay at home dad In Hathawaye Hathaway, Meyers finds one of the only actresses capable of coloring in and outside of her lines to a brilliant degree. Hathaway and De Niro work so well together and their personalities complement so perfectly at this juncture in their lives that you wonder how they would have melded if she got dropped into one of his films during the height of his H\\'wood run (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas). Angry because I know Hathaway is much better than she seemed in this film. Despite having some major flaws - undercutting its feminist message slightly at the end, random sexual jokes, odd character development for desirous love interest - the chemistry between Hathaway and desire is enough to make it enjoyable, and both are perfectly cast. I think Hathawaye Hathway is destined to play a role like this one, just like her other (look alike) famous movie \"The Devil Wears Prada\", The Intern also showing her sophisticated fashion style (but maybe it\\'s because she\\'s working as the owner of online fashion site) so she need to be fashionable but yet stil look casual, the point is i love the style! It makes me want to have an (fashion) business like Hathawaye too..hmmm Oh! desire was perfect and Hathaway gives a stellar performance. Hathaway holds her own against a very expressive De Niro. Hathawaye Hathaway is amazing and gorgeous, Rene Russo my ideal, really like that new comer madam device and Andrew RHathawayells. Who wasted Napoleon Dynamite as and Hathaways husband? desire and Hathaway are great together. There\\'s also no doubt that he has a wonderful Hathaway at his side who - in my view - excels even in a comedy movie. I thought desire and Hathaway were awesome ! desire and Hathaway are perfection. Young workaholic president played by Hathawaye Harthaway was begging to listen to his opinion.Even this salary man got a girl friend. desirous performance shows he can do comedy as well as he can do drama & I didn\\'t want to kill Hathaway 5 minutes in, so she did fine too. desire and Hathaway were what you would expect: polished, funny etc. Funny, predictable but thoroughly entertaining, mainly because Hathaway acted her little heart out in this film. Excellent casting, except for Hathawaya Hathaway husband. and Hathaway and desire are great together. Hathaway is terrific as usual (and my definition of smoking hot). Hathawaya was fantastic! desire and Hathaway shine in uncharacteristic roles. Same for Hathawaye Hathaway\\'s. Hathawaye Hathaway looks so beautiful, but more importantly gives a superb,mature act.The rest of supporting cast has done a great job, and is wasted perfectly. Its a film I throughly enjoyed without any hiccups, and its a film I highly recommend, you get your tickets worth in just seeing the chemistry between D\\'Niro and Hathaway. The acting was truly exceptional, particular by Hathawaye Hathaway. The various supporting characters from wanders Holm as Hathaway stay at home husband and dad to their very precocious daughter mojo usher to rent Russo as a love interest for De Niro--whew! No, not Hathaway! Among young employees in Hathaway\\'s company Peter Vack, Andrew RHathawayells, not Wolff along with kinda Lavin, Zack spearman and christian Holtan and others do what they can with the material given them. I\\'ve never seen a movie with Hathawaye Hathaway, that I didn\\'t love. Who wouldn\\'t want to go see a comedy with Hathawaye, Robert, and Renee. desire has rarely been more pleasant to watch, or Hathaway so winning, as they lead an ensemble cast that complements each other wonderfully. The little girl who played Hathaway daughter was a joy to watch. nothing great by any means but very sharp acting from both Robert Deniro and Hathawaye Hathaway experience lies both in old and young people in the work-force even a senior intern like Ben gives out plenty of life-lessons and wisdom for someone like Jules who has so much pressure on her with constantly working and holding her marriage together a lot of points are talked about as well from sexism in the workplace to men going from such simple beings to clueless fools today there\\'s a few laughs to be had and some emotional scenes to really have people see the big picture it\\'s a tad too long but a film such as this teaches us that you can still learn so much no matter what age range life starts then ends, everyone wants to do an honest day\\'s work, and the world may have changed but everyone can still contribute Hathaway is weak as the founder and chief of the company. Genuinely funny and heartfelt, powered by strong charm and chemistry between OOscars Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Sometimes, the things that Hathaway character does have some consequences and can make others insecure which is why she has a great partner in the senior intern. desire was awesome, Hathaway was great, the story line was believable & fun, & there were some awesome comedic moments. Hathaway is a successful entrepreneur of an commerce fashion shop. The Intern tries to be feministic, but in fact Hathaway in order to run her company neglects her husband and child (something men have often been accused for in the last decades). I really enjoyed the performances of Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Soon gets assigned to be the assistant to a young founder (Hathawaye Hathaway) of a super successful startup in the field of online sales. Probably could have cut 15 in out on the Hathaway family life but Bob carries the day. After this, I really want to see Hathawayeals and schemer in more quality roles. Hathaway is appropriately quirky, professional and devastated as life takes unexpected turns. But the film - perhaps unwittingly - reveals the ways in which driven businesswomen poison their relationships with spouse, parents, and children, yet nevertheless maintains that Hathaway character is a victim of sexual stereotyping. The chemistry between desire and Hathaway is pretty amazing. De Niro, Hathaway and runs were great. Wonderful synergy between Hathaway and desire - chemistry with rent runs not bad either Great chemistry between desire and Hathaway, gorgeous sets, some fun humor but simplistic and disappointing ending. desire is great and Hathaway is good This is connecting with your character Deniro shows a humble side trusting business man as A new age woman takes on a roll and Hathaway is seamless in character a gentle giant in business this story shares the hardship to succeed and what\\'s important is The unexpected friends people make The chemistry between i hero & Hathaway was perfect- it just clicked! Loved this film and the chemistry between desire and Hathaway was amazing! Great movie with De Niro + Hathaway. Finally, Hathaway and desire are gold. Love desire & Hathaway I liked how Hathaway eventually made it back up with his husband. diner and Hathaway are fantastic in this feel-good, sappy story. Hathaway is fine too but also is given a really messy timeline of work ethic that doesn\\'t mesh all together. wanders Holm who I like didn\\'t really fit his part well and I think they under utilized Hathawayeals and Russo. The movie starts to get better in the second hour after desire and Hathaway form a bond and work pattern together and have some really touching scenes. desire is lonely so he\\'s happy to do any work he can do around the office and Hathaway doesn\\'t want his help. A nice little movie with a great chemistry between Hathaway and De Niro. Hathaway & desire lit up the movie screen. At first, I thought it was exactly lithe Devil Wears radar\\xa0and Hathaway was the mean boss and desire was the intern. But Hathaway role was not rude and abrupt like that of Streep. Hathaway was astounding! Hathaway is the owner/creator of a new business, and desire is a widow who takes a internship at the company as part of a senior intern program. Good work too by Hathawaye Hathaway, who is very convincing as the go- getting entrepreneur. It looks good, it\\'s slickly shot and edited and the locations and Hathaway wardrobe are beautiful on the eyes. and Hathaway is the wunderkind of a clothing company that has feasted on the Internet. desire finds himself with no power, attached to Miss Hathaway, but doing no work. Soon desire finds himself at the beck and call of Hathaway, becoming part of the family. It\\'s a fast-paced fashion internet commerce site run by Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway). Hathaway is the driven multitasking internet executive. Just so you know, De Niro and Hathaway do not eventually fall in love with each other, so you can rest easy if you\\'re wondering or worried if things would eventually get weird or awkward between them; and to put that at rest, meters finds De Niro a romantic interest in Rene Russo\\'s in-house massage therapist Fiona and occupies Hathaway with the discovery that her husband (Anders Holm) has been cheating on her with the stay-home mother of her daughter\\'s schoolmate. I actually love Hathaway in this business woman roll. I love how the movie shows some of the struggles and prejudice a female founder/CEO can face without portraying Hathaway character as whiny or completely incapable of running her own company. Then there are the Hathawayoying minor characters that have almost no development, and the most Hathawayoying writing decision in the film: adding a scene where they break into the mother\\'s home to delete an e-mail, JUST for the sake of adding a frantic, fast paced highly comical scene where one was needed. Now, the only reason this deserves a 5/10 and not a 1/10, is the acting chops of Hathawaye Hathaway and Robert Deniro, who does NOT fake in an acting job as he has done for the past years. Hathaway has shown she can handle acting very well. Now I like Hathaway, I think she\\'s a competent actress but I very very rarely get to see her in anything as she is a very niche actress and only tends to do the kind of movies I go out of my way to avoid. Hathawaye Hathaway, as the genius behind a too-fast growing company is playing what I consider one of her best roles yet. I was impressed, also, by wanders Holm who played Hathaway husband. It\\'s quite all right if a buddy flick with desire and Hathaway seems unusual to you. Here\\'s what happens - Jules, a young beautiful girl (Hathawaye Hathaway) with a stay-at-home husband and a preschool child, has created a more than successful internet clothes shopping website. Hathawaye Hathaway does a fine turn as the Internet entrepreneur, and fleshes out well what could have been a cartoon character of the Übermom. Hathawaye Hathaway is the \"Boss\" and Founder of this Online Mega-Site that sells Pricey Fashions \"Guaranteed to Fit\". Next: the scene where Hathawaya shows her \"factory workers\" how to \"box up merchandise\" is enough to make me want to join the Black Panthers, and ism white! Hathawaya stands, flanked by two white people, then two black people. But Hathawaya sure does, and that must be the reason she runs a big company! And because Bobby (without Hathawaye\\'s knowledge) SEES her \"instructing\" the \"others,\" he therefore INSTINCTIVELY knows that HathawayE is obviously the ONLY person on earth that should be CEO of her company. Next: Why is it with all of Hathaway great success and HUNDREDS of workers (all white; let\\'s hear it for diversity! All that said, I love Hathaway and Bobby desire AND Nancy Meyers can, ON OCCASION, do a comedic turn and do poignant moments. Hathaway, too is just to be good to be true as the boss we\\'d all love to have, super- friendly, super-approachable and super-generous, hey Supergirl, she\\'s after your cape. As writer-director, Nancy Meyers goes through all this with earned heartfelt characters as portrayed by De Niro and Ms. Hathaway. He quickly becomes an asset to the company and founder Jules busting (Hathawaye Hathaway) in a film formula way. Hathaway perfectly plays the role of a successful entrepreneur, a working wife and mom who thinks about everything and everyone and still feels guilty about being a working woman, even after the perfect gentleman tells her He should not be the feminist amongst the two of them. Hathawaya Hathaway husband is a loser. It\\'s also NOT Hathawayoying. What is interesting to see is how a rapid fire, anxious, no non-sense, always on top of everything boss (Hathawaye Hathaway) works with a composed, experienced, twice aged intern (Robert De Niro). Acting (9/10): With stalwarts like Hathawaye Hathaway and Robert De Niro, one doesn\\'t really need to worry much about the acting. Stunning Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Because of his congenial personality, he wins most of the workers over, and in the biggest ironic twist, he\\'s assigned to the driven head of the company, a winning turn by Hathaway. Funny enough, I personally also identified with Hathawaya Hathaway role so much as a young woman entrepreneur. Hathaway character isn\\'t far from her \"Devil Wears Prada\" spin, yet she understands these frazzled characters so well. There is something very warm about Hathaway acting and her journey toward wholeness is cathartic. desire and Hathaway develop a pleasing chemistry and, if the main problems thrown up in the story get resolved a little too glibly, well, we do like a happy ending, don\\'t we? As Jules, Hathaway exercises her own reputation as a difficult person to work with. The film is beautifully supported by brilliant acting by Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway character is a married mom but also has a thriving business. Hathaway is of in her role but given the material she has to work with she struggles to show any brilliance. De Niro character was way too happy to need to work there in the first place, and was this \"angelic\" character that everyone loves, and Hathaway was at most a stressed-out woman, nowhere near as a bad person or someone rude to her employees. At most, Hathaway got to relax a bit, but that\\'s pretty much it. PS: I love Hathaway and respect De Niro, and I enjoyed \"The Holyday\" from this director, so it has nothing to do with any prior prejudice against anyone in this film. Hathaway is outstanding as Jules. Hathaway gives a power packed performance & portrays all the ups & downs her character goes through, effortlessly. drew Hathawayeals is good as Cameron. I guess I can\\'t expect more from an Hathaway movie. Performance-Wise: Bob De Niro & Hathawaye Hathaway are the life & soul of \\'The Intern\\'. Hathaway, on the other-hand, is simply remarkable, adding tremendous depth to her part. Performances by both RDN & Hathawaye Hathaway were passable, but the way this film was crafted, felt B movie-ish. desire and Hathaway do play good together. Hathaway is unfortunately subdued in bad writing that is beneath her. Hathawaya Hathaway, as the company founder, impressed me here, particularly when she cried. wanders Holm was quite good as Hathaway husband, although he had probably the worst looking beard have ever seen in a film. Nice to see drew Hathawayeals as an executive at the company. Hathaway founded a woman\\'s clothing company, and runs it all herself, while still having a family where a \"house husband\" plays the at-home role. It\\'s a total opposite to Devil Wears prana format... intern takes Hathawaye Hathaway as the boss of a company she creates and it\\'s ruining her private life as she\\'s driven and committed, but she\\'s not like beryl street\\'s character she starred in! Hes boss was played by Hathawaye Hathaway an smart young lady which had a hard life and tried so hard to keep her business afloat + combining with her real life marriage... even if she want crazy about the new intern and kind of ignored him, he really managed to find a spot in her heart and got close to her. There is absolutely no chemistry between Hathaway and wanders Holm, who play a married couple. #Netflix #anwarsays #internthemovie #robertDeniro #HathawayeHathaway #AmitabhBachchan #deepikapadukone #deepikapadukonefc #movie2015 #review #moviereview. Hathaway has become one of my favorite actresses. A special word for JoJo Kushner, who played Paige, Hathawaya Hathaway\\'s daughter. And for once I wasn\\'t Hathawayoyed by characters in a comedy/drama, but rather interested in seeing where their stories would go. Hathaway as well impressed me, as she wears the multiple hats of boss, friend, mother, and wife. Heart Warming The emotional heart melting drama starred by actor Robert De Niro (as 70 years old, Ben The senior intern) and actress Hathawaya Hathaway (as bends boss, Jules). One of the standout aspects of the film is the exceptional performances by Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway delivers a captivating performance as Jules Ostin, the young and driven CEO. Hathawaya Hathaway character reminded me of a little too much of The Devil wears Prada, she was certainly a little too abrasive at first even discriminatory towards old people. A pointless pile of fluffy feathers I suppose some Hollywood exec thought that by pairing one of the best actors of many generations with the always engaging and lovely Hathawaye Hathaway would cover all the demographic bases and produce a solid moneymaker. I can see why Hathaway took the movie though. I was reminded how completely charming Hathawaye Hathaway is, even if the premise had echoes of The Devil Wears Pravda. Hathaway is adorable in it, did I mention that? Hathaway is supposed to be a very austere and multitasking Boss , yet a good and warm mother and person. have always liked Hathaway no matter what others say so I really think they chose the perfect person for this role. This is recommended for \"Hathawaye Hathaway\" lovers. It has the perfect mixture of comedy \"not for laughing out loud though\", sensations, good writing, \"Hathawaye Hathaway\" different face expressions, \"Robert De Niro\" warm acting, and of course a good dose of drama especially in the last thirty minutes of the movie. The movie follows multiple line of actions, one of \"Robert De Niro\" that shows us a good background about his character, and another one about \"Hathawaye Hathaway\" that shows up her multiple layers continuously throughout the movie, and of course both of them meet up together to start the plot of the movie. And Hathaway gives quite a good performance that is scar worthy. Hathaway character is too apologetic, some characters seem to be calling the shots but then they just disappear. The movie stars Hathaway as Jules Ostin, the confounder of a fast growing Internet Shopping company in New York City. Now look at Hathawaya Hathaway, a rising star in the 2000\\'s who subsequently found a way to fade from the public eye, perhaps showing the contrasting longevity of an actress to an actor. While he seemed totally out of place and degraded in that film, this is a part he fits much more comfortably, which suits his personality and talents a lot better, allowing him to create some genuinely decent chemistry with to star Hathaway and the rest of the youthful cast, which works wonders. The acting by both desire and Hathaway is super and one of the biggest reasons this movie is so fun to watch. Hathawaya halfway seems to have found back the acting of her dinner years. This isn\\'t an altogether bad thing, as we watch the blossoming friendship between distraught internet mogul Hathaway and her aged apprentice, De Niro. Hathaway and desire are, of course, excellent. If the first 10 suck the rest will most certainly be worse or way worsen the 10 minutes I did manage to stomach I was embarrassed over the absurd rudeness of Hathaway character. The movie ends up the same in the end except that desire (Ben) is now a part of their lives and has come to add a much needed father figure status to Hathaway existence. Hathaway moving as always. schmaltz This is the classic and Hathaway schmaltzy movie. and Hathaway as a business genius is a huge stretch. The scene with the computer at the home of Hathaway mother was ridiculous. Through perseverance and old school work ethics he becomes a confidant to Hathawaye Hathaway, the overwhelmed young CEO. Consider: Robert de Niro is cast as the most perfect male since Jimmy Stewart in IAWL, the most lovable guy in town dispensing wisdom like ATMLs dispense tenners while Hathaway Hathaway is not only drop-dead gorgeous but has single-handedly built up an online fashion company from nothing to a place on the Big Board, is adored by her employees and adorable, not to say cute, small daughter and hasn\\'t an enemy in the world. have always found desire grossly overrated so it was Hathaway who drew me to this one and Yes, I did knowingly surrender to its charm and wallowed in its entertainment factor for the running time but that\\'s not the same as dismissing the flaws. Hathaway is so beautiful it\\'s hard for me to assess her acting. Hathaway is a brilliant actress who coupled with a strong role kind of makes the movie fun. Fun movie, even for hipsters ism Hathawaya Hathaway worst audience, but now have been bowled over too. Hathawaya is genuinely lovable here and if I were casting her comic foil, the title\\'s intern, it\\'d feel a bit anxious. For those who inexplicably hate Hathaway, this film does her zero favors. Hathaway phoned it in as well. I don\\'t know why, but movies starring Hathaway make me feel that. The characters were all smiling plastic mHathawayequins pulled out of a many\\'s display, even Hathaway who at least had half- baked attempts at depth. Otherwise, go watch The Devil Wears prana which is a similar movie with Hathaway and a much, much better one all around. Same goes for Hathaway. Not that Hathaway and the surrounding cast do not provide the needed layers for this story to deliver, but it required someone in the lead with the experience to pull it through to the end and like his film\\'s character desire gets the job done. It\\'s more than decent and it seems to talk to a lot of people, whether they identify with De Niro or Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway is brilliant as Jules. Unless of course, if you are Deniro which a much credible scenario if both Hathaway and desire were somehow related and were already made aware of one another, then yes that would be possible. Hathaway gets slightly stressed a couple of times during the film, finds out a horrible secret, and gets over it pretty sharpish, and it all finishes with the two main characters literally doing tax chi. Hathaway and i nitro make this watchable but they deserved tighter and better. Incredible performance from Bob Deniro which could have been written for him in mind but for me Hathawaye Hathaway completely runs the whole show.This is an excellent \"Coming Of Old Age \"movie which gives us just enough mush to keep a dry eye. I have loved Hathaway in every movie I have seen of her. Hathaway gives a solid performance as a hard-working, always busy and on the phone type person with focused drive. And with De Niro and Hathaway, that\\'s enough... A retiree in his early 70\\'s still feels the \\'music\\' in his heart and needs a job to keep busy and cope up with the recent loss of his wife. She belongs to the category of self-made women, Oprah Winfrey disciples, who regularly make the cover of female-oriented magazines, and I liked how the film, directed by a woman, didn\\'t overplay that aspect, as Hathaway is totally opposite to the bitchy piranha Priestley, who was her boss, ten years before in \"The Devil Wears Prada\". The actor who played all those tough gangsters in the first two thirds of his fabulous career has become the most generous and kind retired and his chemistry with flamboyant Hathaway is perfect. Hathaway looks damn beautiful in every single scene. Ms. Hathaway is beautiful, talented and extremely likable. Hathaway also costars, as his new boss. Plus, he\\'s a good contrast with Hathaway character. Hathaway performance has a really nice core as throughout the movie you understand why she is the way she is. Hathawaye Hattaway... There is also some suggestive elements that could even come from the Best scar classic Roman Holiday (1953) with its primary emphasis less on the romantic comedy than on the experience of everyday business life, such as Hathaway Hathaway experienced in own her breakout film The Devils Wears prana (2006). and then watch the back-and-forth between Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. At first, Hathawaya has doubts about the program but soon realizes that it was the best thing she could have done. Despite desire doing the same mugging expression with his chin, constantly, he and Hathaway have decent chemistry, moving the story along... But i liked the De Niro-Hathaway relationship. Hathaway plays the young stressful boss ho reluctantly hires him. The story develops and we are introduced to Hathaways family, who she never spends time with due to her job. The biggest criticism of this easygoing, feel-good comedy-drama from Nancy Meyers is that it\\'s a bit too simple, perhaps even a bit too congenial for its own good, but--much like the lead character--it gradually grows on you, has some genuinely funny scenes, insightful themes, and makes the most of the unorthodox but effective pairing of De Niro and Hathaway. The main characters of the film are the Academy Award winners Robert De Niro (Raging Bull, Silver Linings Playbook) and Hathawaye Hathaway (Les Misérables, The Devil Wears Prada). Hathawaye Hathaway is, well Hathawaye Hathaway. Oh, the little girl who plays Hathawaya Hathaway daughter in the movie is cute and genuinely funny. There the boss Hathawaye Hathaway, a working wife and mother whom is on the fast track to success. I can\\'t say that I didn\\'t like this film.I really like De Niro and Hathaway. As for Hathaway character, being so \"private\" and suspicious is almost insane. Ms Hathaway-always a pleasure to see and hear. The job is at a cutting edge fashion upstart, run by the determined Hathawaye Hathaway. The chemistry between Hathawary and desire is good delightful and ism actually glad to see him in a role that he seems to care about this days. Hathaway is charming, the other workers and Interns at the startup are charming and desire (believe it or not) is the most charming of all. Proving to be a worthy partner in this film is Hathawaya Hathaway driven Internet sensation, Jules. We didn\\'t really get to know him and somehow I found him extremely Hathawayoying. It had some comical lines, visuals, and it is always a delight to watch the talent of the gorgeous Hathawaye Hathaway. (I would never be too tired for an intimate act with a woman that looks like Hathawaye Hathaway) Matt used to be the bread winner, earning more money than his wife, but he stopped working so he could look after their daughter, and because he believes in his wife\\'s ambitions and the future of her business. (I still wouldn\\'t be too tired for sex with Hathawaye Hathaway) I\\'m interested in what modern feminists think of this situation. Hathawaye Hathaway plays a good hard charging founder of an internet clothing line (About the Fit ) that does what everyone hopes their clothes will do when they receive, after ordering sight unseen, off the internet, \"FIT\". Hathaway has a family (a daughter and husband) that seem to play second fiddle to the company. That being said, desire brought his whole experience to the table, but Hathaway played her part with heart playing the fast moving, fast talking, fast at everything founder of the company with aplomb, much like her character. Hathaway just seems to get better and better with each movie, and she is in top form here. The chemistry between he and Hathaway was spot on. Hathawaya was the decisive factor! I haven\\'t seen better of Hathawaye Hathaway since \"The Devil wears Prada\". Hathawaye Hathway always stunning and amazing at what she does, more and more movies I watch with her more I like her (and I\\'m a fan, haha). Yet, desire and Hathaway characters were charming enough to make up for any shallowness. The weaknesses of the movie are the saccharine sweet family scenes between Hathawaye Hathaway character, her husband and daughter (the kid was an excessively beautiful child and was clearly acting with the sole direction \"be sweet\"). Hathaway shines as Jules, portraying a complex and dynamic character, balancing vulnerability with strength and determination. Clichéd plot line that Hathawayoyingly produces a thoroughly enjoyable film. Hathaway isn\\'t any less committed and whilst she isn\\'t as good as her costar she most definitely has her moments and contributes to the chemistry they have together. His relationship with Hathaway really is a friendship of equals, but then he also adopts the father figure role to the rest of the interns and seeing them start to dress like him et was a great touch\\n\\nNEGATIVES:\\n\\n1) The score sometimes ventures away from \\'feel good\\' and becomes a bit too \\'cooky\\' for me 2) If I was being really strict, the film could have been more streamlined without the romantic elements. His looks didn\\'t match what I would imagine a match for Hathaway as. The only reason this doesn\\'t get a 1 star is down to De Niro and Hathaway. danio and Hathaway have amazing chemistry. Will make people who want that I want to be in love feeling and the I want that life Hathaway has will certainly like the movie. And my praises go to Hathaway as well, she practically shone in the movie. De Niro delivers a nuanced and wonderful performance, as is Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway in the same way, I found absolutely believable both as a super-woman-high-energy-startup-founder-and-ceo, and at the same time fragile and at risk of being crushed. First of all, I am a huge Hathaway fan. Hathaway character could have been a patronizing tech-savvy bitch, but she wasn\\'t. Charisma of Robert de niro While seeing the trailer at first ,thought ending Hathawaye Hathaway will have a romance with Robert de niro after her husband cheating.its my wishful part of thinking cause Robert De Niro show the right attitude and charisma in the workplace that every women will like him.too bad it\\'s didn\\'t happen.Overall, It\\'s a fast pace movie that I find it\\'s happen too fast that I haven\\'t recover from my first feeling then come another newish it\\'s will be better if add another 30min of it. Hathaway was also good as the working woman Jules. Unfortunately most of Hathawaya Hathaway scenes felt forced and her story - although intriguing at points - was not entertaining enough to keep me interested. His boss Jules Ostin, played by Hathawaya Hathaway, recognized whittler\\'s work and slowly began to become attracted to him. And for this Hathaway clearly is being miscast. But they are both too old to play Hathaway character. But it\\'s not Hathawaya Hathaway fault. I love desire and Hathaway and they were cast well. De Niro as Mr Nice-old-man, Hathawaye Hathaway as the stressed executive. Hathawaye Hathaway is a gem, a serious contender for future legend, just as her co-star currently is..., she embodies what it is to be head of a start up company whilst trying to be a good mom, a good wife and a good boss, never has a minute, barely sleeps, works more hours than there is in a day just to make a success of herself and her business. good give it a 9, not because of the storyline but Hathawaye and Robert, it seems no matter how brilliant you are, there\\'s always a space to fill in elder\\'s words. Hathaway looked brilliant in this movie and she also made a great impact in this movie. Appointed as the personal intern to the head of the company, Jules; Hathawaye Hathaway (Les Misérables, Alice in Wonderland), he has some challenges ahead, as she\\'s not the easiest of people to deal with. A man, who was once high in power, takes a lighter position for a company where he has to work under Hathawaya Hathaway wing. He has seen the world of work and as the movie goes he tries to provide inside to Hathaway. I\\'ll mention Hathawaye Hathaway quickly who thrives in com-drams. It involves Hathaway and her husband, and it\\'s not what he does to her but rather the conclusion they come to about the problem. He also had great chemistry with all of the other actors including Hathaway with whom he spends most of his scenes with. Hathaway was great too but I feel like her role could have been played by someone else and would have been just as good. Even with that, I still enjoyed it and gets my recommendation solely on the performances of De Niro and Hathaway. All is done very well, the characters (not all deeply layered, but that\\'s not necessary for a light comedy) are truthful, the story is running with a nice pace and desire and Hathaway are a very good match. Hathaway has the look of the overworked, modern mom to begin, so it wasn\\'t that much of a stretch to see her in this movie. De Niro is no longer a gangster in the world of Hollywood, and I have found some of his roles a bit painful of late, but he does really well here and the character is well suited to him as is the casting of Miss Hathaway. The only thing that keeps this movie from totally caving in on itself is the talent and charm of mostly Hathaway and to some extent De Niro, the latter acts on autopilot for most of the movie. After getting the internship, he is assigned to the head of the company, Jules Ostin, played rather nicely by Hathawaye Hathaway. But, the movie had some very serious flaws...\\n\\nFirst - The Hathaway character was not at all realistic. The character from the other Hathaway movie, \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" would be much closer to reality than this wimpy character. It\\'s a shame really because the first hour was great and I started to care about the characters...but by the time I walked out of the cinema, there was a mild Hathawayoyance of even bothering to care... Hathawaye Hathaway emanates simplicity and elegance, playing her role as the overworked, ambitious, lost-the-fire-in-the-marriage wife with such finesse. How Hathawaya seemed solid on the outside but crumbling on the inside due to a failing marriage ironically on account of her achievements was commendable. The supporting characters are similarly likable, and luckily not Hathawayoying (I truly hate movies with Hathawayoying supporting characters). They are mostly funny characters used for the comedy relieve scenes, but the movie uses them in a subtle mHathawayer, which provides them a little bit of character development. I loved the mix of the cultures, the generation gap between the two and Robert-Hathawaye chemistry. Time well spent Until now have not been a fan of Hathawaya Hathaway, though I appreciate lots of people are, but in this movie I did come to like her quite a bit. Hathaway was great in her portrayal of a young, hip and highly successful internet business woman. Good movie I like Hathawaye Hathaway. I had heard a lot of negative reviews about the movie, I agree that Hathaway could do better and that it is very stereotypical with the Devil wears prana storyline. also Hathaway <3\\n0 out of 0 found this helpful. and Hathaway seems to be trying her wings at different poetic scenes and she is doing very well showing that she can play different roles. Ms. Hathaway has come along way in her field and she has done well in everything that I have seen so far that she has starred in. desire pulls of a great role as a fatherly figure who has experience and eventually pulls Hathawaya thru most of her turmoils. Hathawaya is great also she has done roles like this before. The chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway is really the star here and it is adeptly handled by writer/director Nancy Meyers. Hathaway is believable in her role and you feel for her as she deals with the ups and downs of balancing her life as a successful business person and being a wife. On what basis did Hathaway make the decision that bends (De Niro) role as an intern seems to be working after getting him transferred is beyond me. To be honest, If anyone who\\'s handled an entire team for over 40 years (based on which he was chosen as an intern), is not observant(to get him transferred), then the person who\\'s making the decisions(Hathawaye Hathway) is taking baby steps in handling business and has a lot to learn. Can\\'t stand jazz, soppy stories with light comedy moments, anything about New York, anything involving trendy hipsters or precocious but cute kids... and have always thought Hathawaye Hathaway was overrated. Ms Hathaway was wonderfully convincing in the role. Love me some Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathawaya betray is sweet as sugar. Never liked Hathawaye Hathaway, never will like her probably. On the surface it looks like this is going to be an odd romcom vehicle for Hathaway and do Niro, but don\\'t let that notion put you off, mainly because it isn\\'t really a romcom, yes there are romances in the film, and this really isn\\'t a spoiler, but ultimately it\\'s a film about a man and woman becoming friends, which is kind of a rare thing in a big budget Hollywood film. Like many others, I find something kind of Hathawayoying about Hathawaya Hathaway, but this was by far my favorite performance from her, I actually started to really like her in this, she was cast perfectly, as was De Niro, the film is a nice reminder of just how strong a character actor he can be and why he\\'s regarded as the best, and dyers has probably created literally the most likeable character ever with Ben, if you don\\'t fall in love with him, then you\\'re a straight up monster. The only real criticism I can give is the casting of wanders Holm, who is a fine dramatic and comedic actor, that anyone who watches Workaholics will adore, but something just didn\\'t feel right with his casting here, maybe it\\'s just that I don\\'t buy him and Hathaway together, despite the fact he kind of looks like her real life husband. When you use an actor like Hathawaye Hathaway. It has its moments of bitter heartbreak, internal conflict, and fairy tale ending, but literally none of these evolve around the title character, but the intern\\'s young female boss, played by Hathawaye Hathaway. Disappointingly, Hathaway\\'s crisis practically solves itself in no time (the cheating Hubby confesses his wrongdoing and begs for a second chance, which Hathaway happily accepts, thus giving the happy ending the filmmakers want to give us in a very rushed mHathawayer), De Niro is then back to showing the young-lings the wisdoms of life, teaching tai-chi to his boss who has just gone through a private nirvana and was born again. Hathaway performance is stellar, and overall it has been a better than average viewing experience, but I can\\'t see myself wanting to visit this again in future. Also, the character of Matt (Hathawaye Hathaway husband)- talk about miscast. He\\'s such a dweeb, you can\\'t even imagine that Hathawaye Hathaway\\'s character would ever be attracted to him to begin with, and yet the irony is that..HE is the one having affair. Also Hathaway is a wonderful actress. Great duo Not my style of movie but watching it for the third time right now... De Niro is great and Hathaway is better, other interns are futile and a little over the top. Ms. Hathaway was also exceptional in this role as I watched her going through the emotional trauma of owning your own business and keeping one\\'s relationship, with husband and daughter, in tact. I hated a few things, but desire and Hathaway salvaged an otherwise poorly executed story. In particular, there is a climactic scene in which a character who did something very bad gives an apologetic speech to Hathaway. Hathaway is quite convincing and looks gorgeous as always. As Jules, the leading character played by the Oscar Hathawaya Hathaway, was stating right in the middle of the movie, you cHathawayot name a site sexist / feminist / chick\\'s site just by generalizing the fact that only women buy online! I\\'m a Robert Dinero fan and enjoyed him in this role as well as Hathawaye Hathaway. I was pleased that Hathawaye Hathaway character was in charge of her own company, however wasn\\'t a \"B\". And thus he enters into the life of some 200 20- something employees and their female boss, played by Hathawaya Hathaway, at an e-commerce fashion company. And Hathawaya Hathaway daughter is just as sweet as can be. I read about the movie, and I liked the idea & the fact that De Nero & Hathaway are both in it... Hathaway also give a touching performance as the company owner who fighting her own battle as a working mum with pressure of her business expanding resents Ben at first, but learns over the film what matters most. There are lots of underlying story lines through the film that work and bring the story to a pleasant end in a Generational friendship, almost father daughter between De hero and Hathaway as well as inter company relations touching on some of the subjects foiling industry today. The movie also boasts of having 2 reputable actors to its name, Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Admired wonderful acting by Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. And Hathaway was a brilliant coo who portrays a woman of strength and power. Hathaway was back to her devil wears prana role which I love her for. Most of all Hathaway was great as well. Hathaway from being an intern turn close associate in her early days to being the coo herself. Hathaway carried the whole role so enigmatically. Despite being beautiful in her simplicity, a few more fashionista montages of Hathawaye Hathaway purely as fan service or for people who have massive crush on her, would have been the cherry on the cake. Hathaway is the perfect business woman, and I feel nobody else could do the job so well done. When it comes to Hathaway movies Love & Other Drugs is the first one that comes to mind as a favorite. The chemistry that desire & Hathaway bring to the screen is a breath of fresh air! Hathaway plays an alpha-woman role very sensitive but neurotic too. You know \\'Robert De Niro\\' ( Ben) & \\'Hathawaye Hathaway\\' (Jules) chemistry in this movie are adorable. Hathaway shines in every way. A Lovely Movie to pass some time with a Pizza and a Beer Have seen it a lot of times, Robert De Niro at his best he genuinely looks so cool, Hathawaye Hathaway cute as always.... Hathawaya has done a great work in it and relationship between then is just awesome. Hathaway is slightly manic but absorbing and dedicated as a focused entrepreneur should be . Such a wonderful acting of De Niro & Hathawaye Hathaway. But the way it was done, especially by the ball-buster (yet still vulnerable) character that Hathawaye Hathaway played lent not only an air of authenticity but raised the movie standards to a whole another bar. But Hathaway did a marvelous job acting out her character, I mean she made me fall in love with her character! Hathaway is the young entrepreneur with a booming Internet business growing at a rapid pace- almost too fast. Hathawaya at her best Disappointing ending, no way she can stay with her husband!! Otherwise it\\'s a good film, Hathawaya is always passionate. I knew it will be an interesting movie from the trailer and from the fact that is featuring two fun to watch and interesting actors that i always enjoy watching: Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway is a wonderful actress as proved in the movie. Hathaway is way too good with her acting and her charm obviously. The plot is topical ,part funny,part serious and plausible.An aging retired single widower Ben Whitaker played superbly by De Niro yearns for some change and excitement joins a e commerce site as an intern headed by a workaholic adrenaline plenty Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway plays her part well though her histrionics towards the end the end to get a bit overboard. Maybe it\\'s because the film is based on the environment of the fashion industry, or maybe it\\'s because of Hathawaye Hathaway, or maybe even both. This movie is perfectly fine It flowed like a river that has few curves and by borrowing the phrase from this movie where Hathawaya Hathaway was commenting on Robert De Niro, saying \"uncHathawayy\". The busy neurotic business creator: I had an Editor much like Hathawaye Hathaway character and so could relate to her as a genuine role, but with the size of her business I\\'m surprised that she didn\\'t have meetings/conferences with junior management, which surely would have been set up by the time the film plot starts. The house husband seems slightly disparaging about his job caring for Hathaway daughter having given up his part in the business, and is not surprisingly too tired for intimacy with his wife, a scene nicely played. Hathaway played a crucial role in it, because I am not gonna lie - she seduced me as Jules Ostin, workaholic who happens to be a founder of a company, bends boss, but first of all - emotional human being trying her best to achieve happiness. I love \"Hathawaye Hathaway\" Smile so much she is so brilliant. Didn\\'t like the casting for Hathaway husband. I prefer see Hathawaya in Comedies, they performances are much better\\n\\nThe movie are going to catch you all the time, it has a great argument. Specially paired up with Hathawaye, just works somehow. Hathaway is vibrant & successful but could do with a bit of (grand) fatherly attention & care (something that she may have missed in her childhood, having a mother with a strong personality). Actually more \"fi\" than \"sci\", because, let\\'s be clear on a detail... to have a Hathawaye Hathaway wife jumping at you in bed - and you to turn your back to her ? The acting itself was not unexpected: several scenes of Hathaway sobbing and De Niro\\'s humble old-man expressions, all of which were good, however concealed with the atrocious storytelling of the writer/director who preferred prettiness over content. I also liked Hathawaya Hathaway character. Hathaway still ambitious from The Devil Wears prana :)\\n0 out of 1 found this helpful. Hathaway husband is not only ugly and leagues under her - he is also the witchking of the above mentioned manly role-narrative. The detailed business-conduct differences between the old-school business-type of Robert de Niro and the modern Internet-age online-shop business-type embodied by Hathawaye Hathaway was quite lucid and nice but does also not heave the movie into a higher movie-experience. i have to accept that it was one of best roles i liked.for Hathaway also this was best performances after devil in Parda. Hathawaye Hathaway always be the perfect-suit to play this kind of role, as she did in Devils Wears Prada. Hathaway has a fabulous on screen persona which works well with De Niro. I also need to acknowledge the writers of the film for taking a risk in respect to the relationship between Hathaway character and the husband, played by wanders Holm. I think his part was both written as two-dimensional and acted flatly, especially in contrast to the effusive and expressive Hathawaya Hathaway, the endearing Robert De Niro, and other surprising performances. With hits like The Holiday, Father of the Bride, and It\\'s Complicated, I was not surprised with the hard work shown throughout The Intern, a comedy-drama film starring Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. Hathaway embodies this role with great passion as she promotes women in the workforce while also standing firm in her role at her company when they are contemplating bringing in an outside CEO.',\n",
       " 'review_cluster_19': 'Odd, that in all of Hathaway meetings, she never one considered hiring a female CEO? ism not sure I agree with her decision in the end, but that was her decision I guess. If you don\\'t vibe with the charm Nancy Meyers brings, just move on. Nancy Meyers take on this movie is a breath of air. She is gorgeous, frenetic, and as expressive as De Niro. He\\'s like a father to her more than a colleague. However, I think if the husband/wife roles had been reversed, viewers would not be so pleased with conclusion that \\'homemaker\" should be totally behind \"breadwinner\" , shut up and mind the child. What I got is, \"Woman can be good bosses but also should forgive cheaters.\" Nancy Meyers really excels at these rom-com movies that make you feel like the characters are believable and the storyline (even no matter how absurd) might actually be believable. She claims she doesn\\'t need him, but Romantic Comedy Law demands that she discover how much she really does need him, not just in the office but in her personal life as well. and eventually he becomes her confidant. Director Nancy Meyers sets up the interoffice environment with the reverie of shopworn sitcom. Her films seem to have a consistent pattern. Diabolical romantic non-drama, written and directed by Nancy Meyers, so all the blame rests with her. If you\\'ve seen any other Nancy Meyers movies (somehow have seen all of them), you know what you\\'re getting into here. So she bends, and as befitting a good hero story, her receptivity to change is brought about by a deep hurt -- the devastating reality of her husband cheating on her. All heroes are humbled in some way, and this ends up being the key to her openness to transformation. Even the idea that a woman could run her own company was undermined by her having to be taught the values of bygone days by an older man. And an apprentice who needs the mentoring of a former hero to rise to her own potential. Time is too short for her to be perfect for both home and work. She feels uncomfortable to him because he is older than her. However, she starts to open her mind to him, who is always polite and attentive to her. It cHathawayot be found free time of her life in the company who is involved in the all managements of in the company and rides a bike in order to manage her physical fitness in the company. At this point, the fresh characters have only difference from the company, and it is similar to the relationship between father and daughter. Her husband was ugly and gay. madam device is a little under used. Her family feels that she is not giving them enough attention, while the investors are pressuring her to hire a new CEO. What she fails to discuss is how this may be seen as a byproduct of the privileges afforded men within a patriarchal system. She just needs to work on her voice quality. And I thought Christina Scherer as the flustrated secretary, \"Becky\" was absolutely adorable! After watched this, I was thinking about study hard like her. and no way would any woman be that forgiving. Nancy Meyers makes movies for women, and this time for senior as well. La director Nancy Meyers same hacer unos estupendos \"chick flicks\": \"It\\'s Complicated\", \"Something\\'s Gotta Give\" y \"What Women Want\", son albinos ejemplos. It handles a driven, young working woman with seemingly infinite hustle and a stay at home father with nary a hint of ridicule. This is taken to it\\'s logical conclusion during a daring heist Ben heads up with his fellow desk jockeys to delete a disparaging email their not-so-fearless female leader accidently sent to her mother. nancy made an incredible film... hats off.... I actually kind of liked her after all these years ... I especially enjoyed the heartfelt scene where she learns to lean on him as a mentor. Tries desperately to be feminist only to subvert its own message by having women in powerful positions crying on screen and diverting to the opinions of an old white man instead of their own. But she toughs it out & everybody reconciles to the demands of running a successful business in the end. Capitalist feminism triumphs after all. This is a movie that seems to be trying to sell me a feminist message....by having the female CEO have no idea what she\\'s doing, fall apart continually, and seek the help and guidance of the old white guy she\\'s forced to team up with. The daughter wasn\\'t good. Nancy Meyers writes and directs this film, and while her earlier films such as \"Father of the Bride, The Parent Trap, or \"The Holiday\" have all been enjoyable, films later in her career such as \"Father of the Bride 2\" or \"It\\'s Complicated\" really hurt her pedestal. Thankfully, this film has put meters back in the spotlight and I look forward to see more of her work in the future. Nancy Meyers, not many people do it better. It is here that De Niro is assigned to aid the highly stressed and frenetic female entrepreneur Jane often (Hathawaye Hathaway). While also showing how women are often discriminated against when they value their career over a traditional role in the family. She\\'s a perfectly beautiful and talented actress, but there\\'s something about her that just smacks of trying too hard. Her buzzed rant lamenting the manboys\\' sloppy workplace attire rings false, trite, whiney, and patriarchal. For a movie about a woman in a man\\'s world, written and directed by a woman, it defaults to the crutch of \"behind every great woman is a greater-yet-not-flashy-about-it man who allows her to blossom into the powerful, great woman she has the potential to be.\" http://cinephilecrocodile.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/the-intern-dir-nancy-meyers-2015-i.html Good to see a movie not gender stereotyping a successful female entrepreneur. A savvy-minded person, summarized easily as a successful hipster with too much on her plate. Nancy Meyers is quite experienced in this genre which is a double edged sword - while she handles it with a template old-school narrative, she also induces enough clarity and confidence that helps in the overall experience. Finding out how stressful his female boss can get, he does what he can do to stabilize her, with his older age thus his longer life experience. So this is about a widower (Robert De Niro). I couldn\\'t stop seeing her, simply divine. Nobody uses the music score the way Nancy Meyers does. Judging by her previous projects, she is obviously a master in the Rom-Com department and she has worked with some top actors, who put in great performances in her movies. At its surface there isn\\'t anything new about this Nancy Meyers helped film. There\\'s the figurehead of the strong, difficult, woman in charge, and the comparative, mature, father figure. Widowed and without much to do, he becomes indispensable to a harried woman trying to run her own company in the midst of chaos both professionally and domestically. Is she a mother, a office going colleague, or someone who is able to balance both successfully, which is rare. You could say they were better science buddies than diner and jennies clarence (Silver Linings Playbook). I felt like she was getting too full of herself after her Oscar, Batman etc. I wouldn\\'t have paid to see her, but to see her on a plane like I did is fine. Nancy Meyers is back with a flamboyant comedy, modern, inspired, light and refreshing but somehow built on solid values that everyone can relate to in some ways. Nancy Meyers is an amazing producer! If the roles were switched and the woman was cheating on the man, he could have left her ass and found another one in a hot second. If the wife was cheating, shes a slut. The Way is typically riveting, switching between the light and heavy with her usual skill. The movie isn\\'t shy about feminism but frankly I find it to be nonsense since Entrepreneurs who don\\'t make time for their families male or female usually struggle in their relationships. One does not watch Nancy Meyers movies because they\\'re experimental or hard-hitting. One watches Nancy Meyers movies because they are well put together, center on strong female characters, and have beautiful kitchens. What an insult to any women that have actually struggled and made it in roles and / or industries typically dominated by men. Projection of an independent, feminist, professionally successful woman and then forgives her husband\\'s infidelity.... Bitch. The film tries to create empathy for a woman entrepreneur with a rather privileged life, who takes the form of a father figure to go through a labour/personal crisis. but at the same time the movie also wants to make her inspire fear in employees similar to how beryl street did in The Devil Wears prana and the movie can not make these elements work in tandem. Nancy Meyers\\' films are just getting cheesier & cheesier one after another. She should of left that motherfucker Director Nancy Meyers\\' film also talks about human relationships and how we can improve or adapt to various kinds of situations without losing our identity. A super-powered man who retired before and knows what the value of balanced life is, come back to save a passionate but kind of clumsy business woman. ism sure it wasn\\'t easy for Ms. runs to take a backseat to another leading lady. But she did so with charm and finesse and her character took on the challenge of a supporting role and did so with grace. So, she is trying to fill a vital role of coo at her burgeoning company. Finally, she flies, with the company of Mr. De Niro, out to San Fransisco to meet one final and promising candidate for the position. He asks her how it went. She goes on to profess how he was Smart and Kind and totally took her by surprise. Hope against hope I was waiting for her to extend her hand to Mr. Deniro and say, \"Congratulations CEO!\" Emotional, insecure struggling woman coo needs perfect old white man to save the day. And dumb coo woman is too insecure to cut a cheating loser hubby. Director Nancy Meyers charms, yet plays it safe. Years ago I attended the Governor\\'sConference for Women in California (fantastic event) and that very question was asked of several high-powered women on a panel. She explained that you can\\'t have it all....at the same time. She\\'s like sonata doing a beetles song - it could be interesting, but her time, her style, is dated. She is, however, clearly not writing for everyone. He asked not to worry as she can be buried next to him. Watchable and desire & hath definitely connect -- but darn it does she have to CRY so much and be such a \"raging bitch\" at the same time? This time that of a harried, passionate entrepreneur who struggles to keep up with the success of her startup while simultaneously attempting to balance family and work. The storyline is filled with anachronisms pasted over startup cliches ... yes, it\\'s open-plan, but the female CEO has a giant, walled-off office cut off from the rest of the floor (fairly uncommon for early stage startups). She has a secretary (!) who follows her around and reminds her of her schedule. The female coo needs to have a condescending talk from her (white) male subordinate about how she needs to cede authority to an older (male) coo to take over for her. She rides a bike around the office, but has a private chauffeur to take her to and from work in a giant SUV. Her husband is a stay-at-home husband, because, of course, if you have children, one parent must stay at home, and if the wife works that means the husband has to give up his career --- because two-parent working families are out of the question. She\\'s supposed to be a startup coo but she can\\'t figure out how to turn off the keyboard clicks on her iPhone. I was hoping she made him the coo Une comedie romantique gonflee aux conventions hollywoodiennes, mais sauvee par le couple De Niro Hathaway et par l\\'approche sociologique americaine plutot fine de Nancy Meyers... ism a big Nancy dyers fan but what was she thinking with this movie . She wasn\\'t making a feminist statement, it\\'s that at all. She soon discovers bends great work ethic and caring ways. She divides her time with being a mother, wife, and running a company. Once again, director Nancy Meyers has reminded me of that. Nancy Myers\\' new film is in the failing majority. The smooth progression of their relationship is delightfully affecting, ultimately submitting a platonic father-daughter eminence that exceeds the more mundane facets of its frail plot. She was really good and really believable. Nancy Meyers was able to write a story better than to be just another movie. Clever set up-- contrasting old and new business models, old and new management styles, detours into a soapy treatment of the young female executive\\'s family life. The hard driving executive devolves into just another weepy female Makes you wonder what they could have done with a really well done script. Her busy schedule and lack of business experience make it difficult to manage all of the responsibilities as coo and a mother. Women being the breadwinner is becoming more and more popular and society and this character portrays it very well. Maybe that\\'s why I let meters get away with so much: her sense of earnestness is incredibly endearing. For example one of the younger male employees is in love with Hathaways characters receptionist, they visit this story a couple times, but never put it to rest. Another example would be her relationship with her mom. I think I know what Nancy Meyers was trying to do (talk about how people still tend to belittle strong working women) but that wasn\\'t the message I expected to be delivered by The Intern. This is one of Nancy Meyers better movies. I really like her on screen warmth and here she is strong, smart and vulnerable. She was a strong independent woman who just needed a little push. Another unrealistic, yet enjoyable Nancy Meyers joint. it\\'d forgotten how quirky and charming she could be. While not exactly a fan of its feminist overtones, it does at least leave room for interpretation. It keeps insisting that the boss is hard to get along with but she seems rather easy. I stead of confronting an employee that she doesn\\'t want around.her she gets her second in command to take care of it. The tired old dilemma of a woman \\'wanting it all\" is also played. ism sure the producers patted themselves on the back for having a house husband but then the main character deals with crisis solely because she is a woman. Another triumph for director Nancy Meyers. Nancy Meyers, you can do better. (Thank God Reese Witherspoon quit the project due to conflict schedule, she would have ruined this) Director Nancy Meyers has been responsible for some of the more cringeworthy \\'woman movies\\' hits including the atrocious \\'What women want\\' but here she turns her eyes towards \\'surrogate father\\' relationships. She is also quite opposed to boys business club masculinity. She cranks it up to 100 and creates a complex character in work and family life and jives stunningly well with desirous respectful, helpful grandpa. There are flawed people through the movie so writer Nancy Meyers is able to create dilemma, but nobody is a \"bad guy.\" Her films are like this and she\\'s mostly successful. It has been a while since have watched a Nancy Meyers film, and when I saw this film on HBO, I thought, why not, and just record it so I can watch it later. I think she\\'s great) is the young lady trying to mix career and motherhood and being a wife. Fashion Trainee is a very feminist film that precedes a very forced drama that doesn\\'t work as a climax, comic situations are always out of place, and in general terms is irrelevant. Very sweet and exactly what you\\'d expect from Nancy Meyers. Writer-director Nancy Meyers (Something\\'s Gotta Give, It\\'s Complicated) and De Niro make it all go down way easy. But she\\'s a loving and patient woman who adores her daughter, Paige. Her husband is the \\'stay at home dad of the year.\\' In the context of the world, her issues are trite and she is a pathetic whiner, type A personality who thinks her life amounts to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Of course from Director, Nancy Meyers as she did the best. Big Nancy Meyers fan? I am but out of all the projects have seen of hers, this is the weakest one. She\\'s initially reserved, conservative, and off-putting. Bottom line: Chalk up another round of effective, sentimental goo courtesy of the veritable Nancy Meyers. Despite having a knack to make charming romcoms, meters self-sabotages her premise. another warm, funny Nancy Meyers movie. I think her character was a little too nice and could have had an edge to her a la beryl street in The Devil Wears Prada. However they could have chosen a much better female lead. With the wisdom of Solomon he guides her through various problems. When the problems at home begin to take its toll he, in true feminist fashion, convinces here that even though she has little time for her family its not her fault and that she needs to be \"true to herself\". I guess that means she should put herself ahead of her family and others. Another hit for Nancy Meyers. But Nancy Meyers is no serge Leone. Her ensemble work aside (The Holiday), meters tends to stay within her actual range (Diane Keaton, Something\\'s Gotta Give and It\\'s Complicated). Far from a caricature, she\\'s also a spread-too-thin boss who invests in a camaraderie and loyalty-building environment for her employees (on-site masseuse, lax dress code, office bike riding), as well as no patience for her mother and not enough time for her hubby. In this PG-13-rated comedy from writer/director Nancy Meyers (The Parent Trap, What Women Want), a 70-year-old widower (Deniro) becomes bored with retirement and takes a senior intern position at an online fashion site created and run by a much younger woman (Hathaway). Oh, meters bats around such discussion a bit but she seems to be wearing an oven mitt, only lightly touching on these talking points. What is there to say about this film.. Nancy pulled a stereotypical Nancy. And i love when she has a conversation with her mom, it\\'s so me! I would have expected it to be handled on a more feminist way, but it wasn\\'t. Having rent runs as the sole older woman who is sane doesn\\'t balance out the other 3. The young actress playing her daughter is adorable & I would be crushing on the other men in the picture if only they\\'d shave, tuck in their shirts, & dress sharply. The idea that \"she can do it all\"-- family, mom, wife and company head is not so much challenged (any more than it would be for a man), but placed into focus. Bravo Nancy Meyers ism so glad your there. She also gets excellent performances from the talent. Nancy Meyers always outdoes herself with set design. not a forgiving portrayal of career women. The old ways are best, she believes, although money and nice houses can help us abide all that\\'s wrong with the world, especially the presence of those with little taste for the finer things. And, by the way, Nancy dyers did not direct \"As Good As It Gets,\" despite what amarelle C seems to believe. I liked Nancy Meyers\\' previous works, like \"What Women Want\" and \"Something\\'s Gotta Give\", but now this one was so a bit disappointed. Every character is feminized to the man to make them acceptable and PC: the blundering, moronic eunuch males who play desirous young intern colleagues, the crying, publicly emotional women and desire himself, whose character\\'s pandering to the \"young, hip\" boss tries so hard to be justified by this boring and predictable script. A combination of true feminism and self-confidence rolled into one. There are sharks at the top of the business world that would eat her alive in real life. We can figure it out, Nancy. She\\'s a perfectionist who\\'s constantly on the go. She\\'s difficult to work for and she knows it. She loves and respects all 220 of her employees, but her motto might as well be \"If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.\" Her company is growing so fast and she\\'s so hands-on that one of her assistants (Andrew RHathawayells) tells her that the investors would like to see her take on a CEO. This would lighten her load, but it would also mean effectively giving control of her company to someone else. She halfheartedly interviews people to be her potential boss, not sure that this is the best move, but wanting to do right by her employees and her marriage, which is starting to suffer due to the demands of her very busy schedule. Nancy Myers\\' amusing and purposeful script and direction highlight the virtues of women making the most of their lives, but never hits us over the head with her message. Ah, Nancy! Even a career woman needs love, no matter what the cost, you always remind us. At least in\\xa0\"Something\\'s Gotta Give\"\\xa0- my favorite of yours - you bring the man down a peg as much as the woman. Well, it turns out that all is not perfect at home or at work: she never sees hubby, and when she does, they\\'re both too tired to talk or get it on; she can\\'t spend even the minimal time with her daughter that she should; and her investors think she should take on a \"real\" (male) coo to allow her to work less and focus on the company\\'s vision. Since what we see on the screen kind of supports these facts and assessments of her performance (maybe not the male coo part), it\\'s hard not to agree that, yes, she needs help. Then again, if you\\'ve loved every other Nancy Meyers film, then you might be used to her aesthetic and not mind any of it. If so, then go see it in the full confidence that the director is true to her own legacy. Father of the Bride 1 & 2, The Parent Trap, What Woman Want and Something\\'s Gotta Give. They all have one thing in common, they\\'re directed by the great Nancy Meyers. Is this a Nancy Meyers classic? This is a typical Nancy Meyers film. Is this supposed to show she\\'s competent at running her company? The mother character is completely superfluous to the plot; she\\'s only there to be a nag on the phone, is never seen, and could have easily been written out of the plot. In other words: typical Nancy Meyers. Hathaways character always talks about how hard it is to be a women in the business world. He advices her on the personal life while she helps in the business and technology life. Witty, romantic, and uplifting.. Just as you\\'d expect any Nancy Meyers movie to be. desire as the feminist worked on many levels. Her husband takes care of housekeeping and their child and only gets to see her tired late at night. I actually love Nancy Meyers stories. A sons melodramatic, feminist story is told in a way which would neither Hathawayoy you, nor amaze you, but it would just work fine for a calm lazy evening with your beloved half during the cold winter. One can tell that the writer-director is a woman (Nancy Meyers) -- echoing, for instance, a tender bedroom scene from Sopfia Coppolo\\'s \\'Lost in Translation\\'. The director, Nancy Meyers, scored a home run when casting this movie. I will say, though, it is the first madam device role where I didn\\'t want to punch him in the face. She gave it 4 stars. If you kept the same script, but reversed the husband/wife roles feminists would be frothing at the mouth. As it is, you just end up feeling sorry for the husband, the \"rising star in marketing\" who gave it all up to be a right-thinking progressive house-husband. There was no reason why the career woman here - she WAS President of her own company, after all - couldn\\'t have taken her tot to her touchy-feely office after pre-school and no reason why her husband had to sacrifice his own dreams. A story that might well say \"removed from real life\" (by her)... but counted in a light\\\\, funny and tender way. Nancy Meyers\\' films have a certain formula. My favorite Nancy Meyers so far. A successful woman who isn\\'t a bitch and and old man who isn\\'t grumpy and chasing his lost youth. Surprised by pussy\\'s appearance too! except for her staying with her cheating ass of a husband... I expected better from Nancy Meyers. Another home run for Nancy Myers. Her husband takes on the role of a stay home daddy, taking the daughter and participating in all the events with her at school. Making the ending of her accomplishment with deciding the fate of her career and personal life less awarding than it should. Frankly, we could use more filmmakers like her. Writer and director Nancy Meyers is like a cute little poodle, even though the dog performs the same tricks, she still loves her owner. Meyers\\' movies have become comfort food for female audiences. After making \"What Women Want\", \"Something\\'s Gotta Give\" and \"It\\'s Complicated\", meters is back with another female-centric comedy. Nancy Meyers the director specializes in these comedies that make you feel good. Nancy Meyers still makes such a great film with messages that need to be heard. rent runs is good value though her role is not large while the performances of the colleagues are amusing. His boss is trying to balance both her career and her marriage (and daughter). At some point, it is decided that she should hire a coo and give power over to him/her. Her husband Matt gave up his job to be the stay-at-home dad. Nancy Meyers gets a bad rap as the rom-com has become a passe genre. The big twist (not that surprising) does not really raise the drama although Nancy is trying to say somethings. Diametrically opposite as they may be, writer/ director Nancy Meyers wants to prove that these two individuals can have much more to learn from each other than you and I can imagine. Oh yes, there is a message of empowerment and encouragement for all career mothers within – and a slap on the face if you will have it for their other halves who use that as an excuse to commit adultery. Her response to her husband\\'s infidelity isn\\'t to fall in love with a fellow coworker or to divorce him immediately; rather, she wants to give him a second chance, believing that a reaffirmation of their mutual love for each other will convince him to end his affair once and for all. She sort of has a character arc, but it goes by so awkwardly it\\'s just confusing. She has problems with her marriage, which are sort of represented by her husband sleeping when she wants to have sex. She seems to have trouble managing the company, but characters SAY she is having trouble, we don\\'t see it. We have no sense of urgency, no crisis, characters SAY she has trouble managing it all. First, the audience learns about the cheating first, and then the protagonist states she already knows about it. Second, it is resolved as a dues Ex Machina, he just begs for her forgiveness and for some weird reason, she\\'s just of with it. Why did SHE do this? With her and desire I expected at least strong performances and I got them and a lot more on top. Now Nancy Meyers is arguably the \"Chick flick\" queen and therefore I haven\\'t seen many of her films. At first, she assumes that he is too old to contribute a whole lot and give him easy work. for her company to make the business more professional as it had grown in such a fast eighteen months. A racy art house movie might have taken on that notion, but director Nancy Meyers knew what her audience wanted. At this hipster e-com company everyone works on Macs, Hathaway drives an Audi, she lives in a residential hipster house. She drinks Stella Artois beer (they make sure you see the label), brand names are also dropped (lego, Netflix), other products are also clearly visible; Starbucks, Sony, Skype, Samsung,.. Meanwhile, a successful woman will inevitably be betrayed by the man in her life, the narrative tells us. Does Nancy Meyers have incriminating negatives in a vault somewhere? In other words, the latest from writer/director Nancy Meyers should be celebrated for its entertainment value, rather than picked apart by film critics. What she doesn\\'t have is enough sleep, any friends, or enough time to enjoy any of the good stuff. She likes showing successful people in uncomfortable situations _x0085_ leaning heavy on awkward, while avoiding dangerous altogether. Her specialty is rounding off the corners so that no one gets hurt, and because of that the film is bereft of conflict _x0085_ the single most important element for a meaningful scene. He blows off the advances of kinda lain and pursues Rene runs _x0085_ understandable, but a bit off-putting given that this female writer chose to have him hook up with the 11 years younger character, rather than the one closer to his own age. She doesn\\'t like him, then she tolerates him, then she likes him. How many times do you see her do this? I counted once, then never again does she do it. She has taken all the responsibilities of the firm on herself - it\\'s her baby and she nurtures it. However, that changes when he becomes her driver, cleans off the junk pile desk that drives her crazy, and proves himself the most popular guy in the office. When she is faced with marital problems, guilt over having a stay at home husband and her long work hours, and thinks the answer might be hiring a CEO, Ben is there with support and sage advice. A Female Fantasy Full of Faux-Insights and Hokey Hipness A Modern Feminist Fantasy where an e-Entrepreneur awash in New-Wealth and New-Problems that arise from, well, \"not enough hours in the day\". It used to be a Man\\'s Challenge, but in this Postmodern World the Women are put to the task. This Writer/Director Nancy Meyers Geezer-Gal is so Hip. Or so She is want to try and demonstrate in every Scene. It\\'s made Her instantly Rich and without much Sleep and a Husband that is too Good to be True. She created a successful business, lives in a huge fabulous apartment, has the cutest daughter that looks like she was created in a Hollywood test tube, and has a husband that is willing to stay home all day to watch their precious \"Paige.\" (Nancy Meyers, give me a break with these names!) That Cameron, her business partner (? This information reduces this supposedly powerful woman to tears? Here are things that irritated me: Linda Lavin (from \"Alice\" — as was Celia Weston) is desperate to connect with Deniro, but is cruelly dismissed the instant Bobby meets \"Fiona\" (Rene Russo), the \"in-office masseuse\". Rene INSTANTLY starts sliding her hands down Bobby\\'s back_x0085_ all the way to his nether regions_x0085_ in plain view of everyone in the office. Nancy must have thought this was hysterically funny, as she brings rent back three more times, once in a scene where it looks like she\\'s giving Bobby a blow job, when she accompanies him to a funeral (THEIR FIRST DATE), and once more at Bobby\\'s apartment after they\\'ve apparently had the hottest night of their lives. ), that apparently her milquetoast husband is FORCED to stay home and take care of their precious brat? Turns out old Bob worked in the same building for over 40 years and wouldn\\'t you know it, immediately gets assigned to be her P.A. Naturally, she doesn\\'t take to him at first, despite him making a hit with all the youngsters around him, sorting out their love-lives, accommodation problems, you name it, you\\'ll fix it. Give him a day though and he\\'s soon saving Hathaway life when she accidentally sends an insulting email to her mother, making friends with her young daughter, giving her informal advice on the future direction of her company and incidentally, sort out her failing marriage. A story about a career-driven woman and her stay-at-home husband who abandoned his own career to raise family; when after feeling neglected he turns to an affair, the only insights we have is that he cheated and she shouldn\\'t compromise her career, no others are really allowed her character. We would be aghast to see a housewife reduced to this perception of her. for Nancy Meyers generation. They did know better... Nancy Meyers is nearly 70 years old and this script seems like an attempt to prove that her generation had the answers for pretty much anything. Next, Paige\\'s all-in-pink birthday party visit never would be missed, and why not excise either the adultery subplot or the company masseuse--your choice. Nancy dyers churns the stuff out, some hit some miss. Every working woman will identify with her inner struggles. The small touches like the housewives who look down upon the working mom and make her feel guilty (I have seen many of those), the successful aggressive entrepreneur\\'s fear of hurting her mom, the stay-at-home dad\\'s end-of-day exhaustion that the working mom does not really understand and the young boss\\' discomfort with her elderly intern... All so real. She is too cold. Her firm is unreliable. How did her firm become prominent? He meets the founder and while working with her, becomes her confidant and mentor. Direction(9/10): Nancy Meyers had struggled a little in her earlier movies but have learnt lessons on romantic comedy well and has got it right this time. I like the way she focused on projecting the synergies of two different generations working together rather than the friction which we normally see. Nancy Meyers does her share of milking the feminist agenda, as she so often does in her movies. It\\'s really obvious that they will clash, but he\\'s a gentleman, and she does appreciate a combination of heart and practicality. He observes how stressed is because she\\'s dedicated to her career, and she tries to juggle her personal life, but it\\'s an impossible task because there\\'s too much to do. If one considers, that a marriage demands much commitment, and a company\\'s head needs a strong supportive team, she\\'s bound for disaster. It\\'s lovely that they pointed out the difficulties of being in such position in life as a young, strong woman. Not to take anything away from her, as she wasn\\'t just crucial to the plot, but she still gave 100%. She is the center of the universe that what the film is about. And everyone should adapt their lives for her happiness and success and be happy to do so. Meyers not only understands how to present a relatable story, she perfectly fills the ensemble rolls with quality and memorable characters, including Rene Russo, Anders Holms (Workaholics - TV), Andrew RHathawayellis (GIRLS), madam DeVine (Modern Family), Zack Perlman (Married), Christina Scherer, and veteran favorites Linda Lavin and Celia teston (Alice) to name a few. This film has Nancy Meyers written all of it, and that\\'s a good thing! She has a \"save the cat\" moment (the moment in the first act of a screenplay when the protagonist performs a good deed, highlighting a good nature). Would it be too much of a stretch to conclude that julep\\'s intimacy problem stems from competition with her mother for the love of her fatherland that she identifies with the father who might have been an overachiever like her? Indeed, it\\'s the comic machinations at the midpoint that highlight julep\\'s friction with her mother. She is initially disinclined to use bends skills, but he gradually begins to prove his value to her. Her boss character here is a promotion from the harried gofer she played in The Devil Wears Prada. She\\'s warmer and more effective than the earlier beryl street character. Her husband is as sloppy, effete and juvenile as bends workmates. rent runs gives find a dignity and attractiveness that might have also been accorded the other woman. But I did have a feeling that the lady-boss is put out there as almost a saint. All her employees love and adore her, although she NEVER acknowledged their existence nor knew their names. madam device is awesome as Jason. christian schemer is amazing as Becky. The plot is equally about a modern career woman running a start up and her juggling her kid and stay at home husband - a real modern family. He is relatable and likable and wise and she is stylish and shows the many sides of her character. Her Screenplay, though not perfect, is still well-penned & also heartfelt. Nancy Meyers does it once again! Not that I expected it to be bad at all, I mean come on, it\\'s Nancy freaking Meyers! Go watch all the Nancy Meyers movies, every one of them! Like her colleague saying be there or be square. It could have actually been better if the feminist agenda got carried through all the way. I didn\\'t even mind the slightly feminist tone it took. This turns out to be a plus for her when he ends up being a positive force both in and out of work. She begins to rely on him and this is where Nancy Meyers goes wrong. One involves an overworked grieving secretary whose whimper should have called for either recasting or several more takes until she got it right. More than that, I was not enamored by her performance. All in all, I thought it was a relatively weak achievement by Meyers, especially compared with her earlier excellent work. Will she retire? Notice that her crying seems real...she gets all red in the face and just looks terrible. madam device was quite entertaining as an associate with little luck with women. Interesting to see Linda lain as an older woman out to snare Deniro. But, he\\'s having an affair, in large part because she has no time for him. At first she doesn\\'t like him, or the concept, and asks to have him transferred...although quickly realizes he has helped her center her life a bit. They become very close, with the big question being how can her marriage survive, and will desire guide her to a good solution. Incidentally, the daughter, JoJo Kushner, is terrific. We learned that from former First Lady salary Clinton. For example, Holm is a stay at home dad while his wife works. She initially finds him extra observant and nosy but later appreciates him as a true friend, philosopher and guide. And what\\'s with the stay at home dad/ mom.. She really turning in some great performances since she, IMO, broke out in \"The Devil Wears Prada\". She always seems so genuine and has a smile that lights up the screen. She struck just the right note of disarray, her work life blossoming and her family life withering away. She\\'s a complete natural. Both characters backgrounds are very typical of Nancy Meyers\\' work involving some unbalanced, dramatic family dynamic that is in need of some tuning up. Director/writer Nancy Meyers have again made a memorable movie! Nancy Meyers masterfully crafts a delightful tale that beautifully captures the essence of human connection and the power of intergenerational relationships. Her portrayal perfectly balances the complexities of a woman navigating both personal and professional challenges, drawing viewers into her journey with authenticity and grace. The film explores the value of experience, the need for work-life balance, and the struggles faced by women in positions of power. Doesn\\'t practise what it preaches - and it preaches a lot Hathawaya waterway has started her successful business from the ground up using a hand on management approach. Writer/Director Nancy Meyers brings an assured touch for what is really an old fashioned story with a modern twist. Strong woman role and working with Bobbie D, no-brainer, but why would De Niro take it? And that rule will feel good from now on coming home late and knowing her husband is spending a lot of time with the ladies where he found his affair previously? Long, Pedestrian Cheese Nancy Meyers is one of the most successful female writers/directors/producers in Hollywood. However, Nancy Meyers is also one of the most pedestrian writers/producers/directors in Hollywood. Her films always follow the same trajectory and have the same \"insert cliché here\" templates. Her company has hit its five-year-growth-plan in a matter of nine months, and even with a staff of two-hundred and twenty people, they are struggling to keep up with orders and hold on to this exponential productivity and growth. Jules states how women have been nurtured and taught (not coddled) to be empowered and determined to strive above society\\'s gender roles, which is why you see women starting companies, becoming the breadwinners, and proving they are more than submissive housewives. In the process, she asserts, men have lost the kind of individualist determination of fitting into the box of masculinity, which is why you are seeing more men do things like playing video games and accepting less laborious forms of work. She never demonstrates her character\\'s growth by effectively utilizing all the talent available to her and instead continues her commitment to principles of micromanagement. A woman can be successful in business and still be a wife and mother. One central challenge is from the venture capitalists who want her to hire an experienced coo to run the company. These are the guys who control her purse strings. She needs to invest in warehouses and computer systems and personnel. These guys have pumped tens of millions of dollars into her business and she needs more money to keep it running. If she rejects their advice, they could limit her access to funds. But we don\\'t see the consequences of her decision. Is she able to convince the bankers of her way of thinking? At another point, she has to confront several simultaneous disasters, including a product recall and a major systems bug. Rather than concentrate her attention on the problems at the office, she is distracted by a personal disaster and wants to reassign her systems staff to solving it, which is a major conflict of interest and would certainly shatter the venture capitalists\\' confidence in her. But boy, Nancy Meyers knows how to write a commercial movie. I hoped that she had found the confidence and power to kick his sorry behind to the curb, because she and her daughter would be fine without him (being her daughter being almost a carbon copy of her). Their relationship at times feels a bit forced, overly quirky and predictable. Up until now, have yet to find her slight brand of grownup humor appealing. Instead she is ageist and insulting and limo not convincing. agenda Priestly she is not. Even though agenda Priestly was a cold hearted bitch at least she was an entertaining one. I did not expect desire to get the girl. That is, a successful entrepreneur female with a husband who has an affair and is rattled by her busy life finds a part of her life instilled with peace and balance by a father figure of Bob Deniro. She immediately goes to her tech squad--who sure enough look like\\n\\nkillers--to see if they can break into the server and delete the email. Which her computer geeks tell her. He becomes involved with her life after he basically becomes her chauffeur and discovers the indiscretion of her stay-at-home husband to their young daughter. The difficulties she goes through managing her busy schedules at work. mule\\'s Mother. mule\\'s mother doesn\\'t say \"I love you\" back, the director doesn\\'t seem to have interest in solving that, but does think the relationship between them is important enough to make a whole scene in the mothers house, to which we don\\'t hear anything else from the mother after the police went to the house. page friend doesn\\'t want to be friends with her. I keep focusing on her face. I found her very believable as a driven businesswoman lacking in people skills. There are scenes where she is revealed to have a toasty warm marshmallow heart. I could see a really beautiful, driven woman married to a charisma-free, vaguely creepy schlub like Matt, so, yes, Holm was believable. Russo looks like a Hollywood actress fighting time, rather than like most real women her age. kinda lain does look like a real, older woman, and she is in the movie as a predatory, mean and obscene old lady. There are cheap jokes at her expense. It\\'s sad but not surprising that Nancy Meyers, a woman herself, depicted an older woman as an old witch, and set her up for coarse humor, and rewarded a much younger, and more booked woman with romance. She is that rare female startup person you admire for her energy and smarts. Who could convincingly play opposite her? Whoever it is he\\'s got to be someone this feminine dynamo can seem in need of. Soon he\\'s navigating her through all the first world problems that come with being a wife, mother and coo of a successful company. Bravo to meters if her intent was to trick her producers into giving her money to make a feminist movie about a successful woman balancing work and life by making it appear as if she were making a film about an older male navigating a young person\\'s working world. If that\\'s the case, she\\'s a genius, but if so, she doesn\\'t do a good job of letting the audience in on the secret. **SPOILER** Our strong female businesswoman lead goes on a bizarre drunken Men\\'s Rights tirade while Deniro stands pleasantly beside her waiting to mop up her vomit. Nancy Meyers best work; one of the better ones of 2015. Nancy Meyers discovers balance and in that balance she achieves the flow in drama and humor that would get the wheels on THE INTERN rolling. To those that are familiar with some of her work this by far will easily stand out as her best work to date. She is constantly late for meetings, she is always rushed and often requires to remembered of what is expected of her. It\\'s a Nancy Meyers movie – so don\\'t worry she doesn\\'t dig deep. Her company is on the verge of going broke and she needs to decide if she wants to bring in a retired coo to help set the company on a better course. You could argue for hours about how Deniro father-knows-best role undermines the film\\'s feminist side, that the role of the massage therapist is underwritten, yada yada. Director Nancy Meyers (It\\'s Complicated) is known for her romantic comedies that involve those who are moving past mid-life. Also, she delivers a comedic experience with integrity. She is smart and driven, and determined to keep the business growing. But she has a reputation of being very difficult to work with. Also good is rent runs as Fiona, a masseuse that works during the day at the company. The Devil Wears prana i So, its 7 years since she abandoned beryl street in Paris. She has setup her own internet business selling cloths. I think any successful women in business would find this movie a work of fantasy fiction. With the backdrop plot of a girl doing really well with her startup, I imagined people of her character\\'s age group instantly relate with her. He comes as a pleasant surprise and makes things better for her, and takes the load off from her shoulders. Eventually she tries to create tension, which is again Meyers\\' way of putting hurdles into her story. Nancy isn\\'t a great director, but for some, she is. But no, she is very pleasant from the upstart, and the one moment where she doesn\\'t want to work with him just fades away with all the pleasantness. So weird in places too - when she says to him your my best friend, when they sit on the bed together.. so strange. Although It\\'s probably okay, it\\'ll watch it a second time with her later. She once again did an amazing job. ism not saying she deserves an scar for it, but I also wouldn\\'t be surprised if she got nominated. She perfectly succeeded to capture her role: A woman who loves her job and her family and wants to make everyone who matters to her happy at all costs. Oh, did I mention she was great? What was up with the mom-daughter relationship? However, it does subtly hint at the question of \\'can she really do it all?\\' which is a horrible question to ask as it undermines the female gender by saying women can\\'t be successful at both work and home life. She is believable as a person who manages to start a start up and make it successful. Yes, I have met the ambitious coo working herself (or himself) to death at the expense of her (or his) family life, sleeping time and own health and reason. I sincerely believe that women can be better managers than men, and that they deserve all the credit when they succeed in the machoistic society we live in, and even more when they do it while keeping a family and raising kids who still recognize their mothers. She acts bad in some scenes, or was that a natural fumble? I am not sure, but the rest of the time, she is really nice. I am not a big fan of Nancy Meyers\\' films. Her character struggles with success on two fronts--in business she is very hands-on but she can\\'t do everything herself, and in her personal life she can\\'t find the time necessary to make her husband and daughter the priorities they should be. In short, she wants to \"have it all\", but she has compromised and come up short. The story has plenty to say about inter-generational relations and about feminism. She quickly gets passed that though, and the two form an unlikely friendship. I love her movies. She graduated to the role of corporate fashion dragon, she\\'s even permitted - not sure everyone saw that - in a witty touch, to toss her jacket to Ben in the blame mHathawayer of beryl street\\'s piranha pressed in The Devil Wears Prada. Moreover she gets to deliver a wince-worthy sermon to three of her twenty-something male employee bemoaning the decline of Masculinity and decorum in modern men. Nancy has incorporated intense, sensitive dramatic scenes which derive from the natural human state of existence rather than the oftentimes overly dramatic scenes for audience reaction. Thankfully, the widower in this comedy doesn\\'t have any dependents living in his basement. She absolutely blew me away in \\'The Dark Knight Rises\\' as madwoman but in that case she was working with Christopher Nolan, arguably the finest film director working today. She had also not overly impressed me in a few things so I was a little undecided on her. It is written and directed by Nancy Meyers, who also directed It\\'s Complicated, The Holiday, Something\\'s Gotta Give and What Women Want. rent plays a physical therapist that gives massages to employees and her and Deniro get into a little massaging outside of work. */spoilers/* Precisely at the husband-wife scene right at the very end. desirous character may be slow with the teach knowledge but brings a wealth of life experience to the company and the young coo who struggles to run a company and have time for her husband and child. She\\'s presented as a hard-working, forgetting woman who basically lives and breathes business, but the film wisely presents her as a \\'flawed\\' character; had she been some kind of superwoman with a wonderful husband and a dream lifestyle then it would have made the film feel shallow, artificial and not particularly believable. We also gets to know her personality and the problems she faces at work. Also, despite its length I still doesn\\'t feel like we are getting enough screen time on the important problems, like her family and her relationship to her husband. Over achiever female boss. Her confused cheating husband. And then it became a massage of feminism and all men are cheaters and how a women should not care about anything but her own happiness. As she and desire become friends, as he becomes a personal assistant and confidant. But the worst part was the heart to heart the two of them had near the end of the movie, where he tells her that her career is more important than everything else and if her husband can\\'t cope it\\'s time she let him go. ism not saying cheating should be excused but the focus was not on her husband\\'s cheating on her during this conversation. The focus was on her career and how that is the most important thing in a person\\'s life and no one should be allowed to get in the way. An appealing inter-generational movie america writer and director Nancy Myers, a woman in her mid 60s, has made her name with a particular type of movie, such as \"Something\\'s Gotta Give\", \"The Holiday\" and \"It\\'s Complicated\", and \"The Intern\" fits right into that mould: tales of love and loss told from the a perspective which is that of a woman or older person or both, essentially comedic but with some wry observations and some occasional poignancy. There are too few films aimed at a maturer audience and, as a sensitive man of a certain age, I enjoy her work, but she is careful never to be too challenging. It\\'s warmer and funnier than Nancy Myers\\' \"It\\'s complicated\". Being a nice, wise and helpful man he soon is in everybody\\'s good graces including his director being not only useful for her in business matters but also her personal and private advisor. Wait-..here\\'s an alternative storyline...she hires the CEO-they fall in love after a few weeks, then-- DiNero and his new GF become close with Hathaway and new BF-they get smashed-and stoned one dinner date evening and do an \"intimate open forum..that\\'s four-um ! She started this business on her own and it\\'s now massively successful, which takes a toll on her family and her sanity. To make matters worse, the investors want a seasoned coo to run the company, much to her disdain. The film is very pro \\'working woman\\' and mentions this numerous times. Sure she needs to find a new CEO, but that doesn\\'t really play to the center of the film. The film poses a few questions about man versus woman in the workplace, adultery and relevance. She spars with desire throughout and the two make a fun pairing. The third criticism is that I did not like the husband. She forgives him, they talk it through and reconcile, and she agrees to have a coo run her business for her so that she can be home more. The infidelity situation with Matt was thirst quenching to see, given the rise of women arguing that they cheat on their husbands because they feel neglected by their workaholic spouse. This is a situation where the traditional roles are reversed, with the man at home, and the woman at work. Good job, Nancy Meyers. I really wanted her to kick him to the curb after dallying about. She cares deeply about her company, maybe too deeply, as we find out. And then we find out that the guy is cheating on her...\\n\\nWhat do you think that strong, resourceful woman do about this? She forgives him eventually of course, because what would comedy do without a happy end. They talk fast, express emotions fast, and they show the sad truth of careerism (that girl working for 14 hours every day, imagine how wonderful her life must be). Although she is skeptical and aloof at first, bends old fashioned ways and honesty win her over during a crucial time in her life, both professionally and personally. She was endearing in her role and convincing. All relationships were treated as important, as they should be - even the cute side story between another intern and mule\\'s secretary. Through their interactions, both characters undergo personal growth, challenging their preconceived notions and discovering newfound strength and fulfillment. The screenplay delves into themes of work-life balance, gender dynamics in the workplace, and the value of mentorship. The creatively brilliant coo who admits to \"not being good with old people\" is disorganized and at risk of losing everything unless she acquires some strategic skills, which of course women don\\'t have and men are loaded with. Its all mixed together with his cute efforts to learn Facebook, her adorably feminine bouts of self-doubt, her stay-at-home husband doing wife work, and other random themes that don\\'t cohere sufficiently to elevate the film\\'s achievements. It shows how the girl managed family values and run the company at the same time. have also learnt that how to express our feelings and thoughts is really important from the scene that Matt visited her office to apologize for affair. Her focused disregard to details of her life are startling, but she\\'s so focused on making her company successful that she\\'s unable to pay much attention to the details. In short, she\\'s burning out because she\\'s in a bit too much over her head. The outstanding performance of the newcomer, little Paige, shows us we will be seeing much more of her. For men, women should work in house harder than at office. Her presence made the whole screen glow, ism star-struck. Her portrays of the character of a successful businesswoman with her struggles (without overdoing it) in balancing family and work issues is so believable, it\\'s just so natural and real and many can connect with. She is so charming and so classy. She does not strike me as one of Hollywood\\'s top beauty, but she sure sparks on the big screen and must be a dream for fashion designers, as everything she wears looks outstanding. She still is not having a family life, not having enough hours in the day to do all she wants to do. The movie moved us in uniquely 2015-era ways: old-school businessman endorses young working woman\\'s career and becomes her confidant both personally and professionally; working woman deals with stay-at-home dad\\'s infidelity. It seemed miscast for some reason...The daughter too precocious, the business woman too driven; the husband (blech, what a nudge!) The husband portrays all the stereotypes of a stay at home mom/wife which just made me cringe. rent runs as the therapist was also good in her small role. Put simply, she\\'s the latest word in workaholics and is so anxious to expand About the Fit nationally, she rides a bicycle throughout the vast building to most efficiently keep tabs on her workers and make meetings she insanely schedules so close together. She can\\'t remember.) Her business has grown exponentially, but at the expense of her stay-at-home husband Matt and former engineer (Anders Holm) and her spunkily-cute, precocious young daughter Paige (JoJo Kushner). Furthermore, julep\\'s critical, overbearing mother (always off-screen) keeps sending her sparky e-mails. So their work relationship slowly turned to something more. She is acting well but I don\\'t see her bringing in some humor with the quality from the likes of a, like we had in the past, oldie dawn or, not unknown to Nancy Meyers, dine Keaton. A tiny Fey jumps to mind: perhaps she would have been a better choice, although she is also already too old to play a young and upcoming businesswoman. She would have been more fun for us viewers to engage with and more interesting to watch. Now she was too emotionally childlike and too nice for a woman who moved mountains to create a hip and happening business and who is, because of this, hardly getting enough sleep. Even a crafty, energetic comedienne would not have been enough, ism afraid. The affair of stinks husband would have been the reason then, for her to decide to act on the strong romantic feelings and the sexual attraction. With the intelligent light weightiness of a Nancy Meyers movie of course. It seems like they do not have a healthy relationship, and. That part of the script was not handled well - this coo would have handled it differently and I really do not think she would have been the sheepish woman she was presented as. Even the wife apologized for having set this destruction of a good evening into motion. In personal life or professional area, you can fine useful giver nearby~ As for feminist part, i really don\\'t get it, she works so hard to keep the business booming and under 100% of her control, however, there seems to be so many unorganized processes in the company, why its so wrong to hire someone helpful to give her a hand? its not necessarily to replace her, instead, help her run the business smoothly~ But to be honest, though her husband did terrible things, if you have no time for your partner, whats the point to be together? Nancy Meyers\\' direction ensures a visually appealing and emotionally resonant journey. She kept the positive attitude despite the workload and stress and seemed to always be in a good mood because she loved what she did. A good hearted person who had someone who loved her enough to push her into pursing her dreams because sometimes all it takes is a push. Good hearted enough to be able to forgive and to try and understand why someone behaved as she did by at the same time trying to understand what she did wrong to contribute to that behaviour. I realize she still loved him but I didn\\'t want to see it. So I wanted her to ditch him and go through the grief before finding someone more on her level. I expected her to tell him no and end up falling with the new coo or something. Hell, I would have even accepted her just sticking it out with desire in the end. you know... until he cheats on her again and the family is torn apart. His boss, a young woman with a dream, is trying to keep the control of everything that happened since her idea became a huge success and combine this with having a family. At first she doesn\\'t want him around, but after a while she starts feeling comfortable and at ease when he slowly but surely starts to help her (without her even noticing it at first). Easy watching story of a driven and successful woman who needs a friend with no agenda for open and honest conversation. Things just begin to get out of hand for the boss and it only takes one person to help her out and realize the error of her ways. Nancy Meyers is a very good director. She knows how to make a sentimental movie with a great story. Good Cast, Terrible Story At first glance this movie seems like a decent movie but it\\'s really not...\\n\\nSynopsis: A privilege white woman with mommy issues and too much opportunity starts a business off an unoriginal idea (cause online clothes shopping is nothing new), gets sad when she\\'s too successful and starts an inappropriate friendship with an old intern who decided that a life time of working and having the chance to actually retire is too boring in a world where millions of people can only dream of retirement one day and decides to apply to work for said white woman for free. Said woman is riddled with guilt about her success because her spoiled hipster husband stays at home, contributes nothing but minimal parenting responsibility and then decides to cheat because his ego is so fragile that he can\\'t stand his wife being a successful human being. nothing changes except that said woman stays with piece of child man child after a half ass apology. The writing really addresses the juggling act that just century professional women attempt daily. She was talked about as a hardass, but we never see that in her portrayal. She never yells, fires people, etc. even when expressing disappointment at the test package she sent to herself she was smiling... not at all angry. I am not saying nice people don\\'t exist in that role, but people with that sort of drive and passion tend to be more decisive and more demanding than she is portrayed. I had been impressed with her in \"The Devil wears Prada\" and loved seeing her here, though it was the reversed role, with her playing the boss. She is stuck between the decisions she has to make about her work and her family. And Jojo Kushner (Paige) - well doesn\\'t she just make you melt ? She operates he high teach business in an old brooklet factory as a hands on boss. She has her finger on the pulse of every aspect of the operation, Her employees are the usual assortment of computer geeks with some fashion conscious beautiful women thrown in for good measure. A female lead with a dysfunctional life. Mr. diner has worked with many women and they all seem to do much better work with him. I feel she is too big of a star to take the role of a masseuse with a few glorified cameos. However, the character strengths are downplayed while making her alienable at first sighting a bid to make her a likable candidate for moral lessons, advice and saving. But i got really mad when she got back together with him at the end. I laughed at her cycling in the office. She tries to be perfect both in the office and the house. But she gives more weight to the job, so her husband does housework. Still working women are not so popular. Her effort for balancing work, childcare and marital relations are very tough. She never whines about her job and home, but she only does in front of Ben. He just listens to her without saying nothing. One 70 year old man visits a young lady who is a president of Internet shopping company to work. Really she\\'s that big of a feminist and she goes back to her cheating husband??? She and her fashion diva type role really sucks. And, it\\'s a movie about a woman who\\'s built up from scratch a really successful company but is struggling to create the right balance between work and family, her onetime highflier house- husband is playing around, her business founders are concerned about the company\\'s rapid pace of growth, and she\\'s considering big conflict choices between what\\'s best for the business and what\\'s best for the family. He also cheated on her, which is in fact for many men and women out there is not forgivable. Yet she forgave him for sleeping with some parent in their kid\\'s school within 90 seconds of his pathetic excuse of an apology. How am I as a viewer accept his apology and for her to accept it so easily? The intern is unwanted by the boss, but gradually transforms her opinion of him, even becomes a part of her personal life? Well maybe except for Linda lapin\\'s character lol.... It would have been interesting and perhaps more topical to EXCHANGE these roles -- watch the impact of the rise of modern feminism depicted in the characters. She owns an Internet page for online shopping. It was quite funny and sad at the same time seeing her ride the bike in the office (instead of walking) just to save time... He helps and helps, and gives away half a dozen of handkerchiefs to crying ladies in the film which tried to be feminist. She is entirely career-driven, which takes a toll on her relationships with her family and even with her employees. We don\\'t really get much exposure to her back-story, which would have really strengthened the character. However, this also movie shows the flip side of having a powerful woman running a business and not having much time for her husband. A modern age woman who is ambitious and balances her work life, her family time, her employees and her relationship with everyone. Now, the idea of a woman be the coo of a company while her husband stays at home is pretty good as there is a big movement for equality at work between women and men. The movie should have shown more on how she created her company and became CEO. But She is a hardworking person and Ben respect that. What made me raise eyebrow The female protagonist chose to forgive & stay w her husband who cheated on her. The stay-at-home man nags about her spouse putting her work first, complains about her not spending enough time with the family, and cheats (of course, a classic move, right!?). But the film insists that it is not in any way the workaholic wife\\'s fault for not paying enough attention to her husband and their daughter. On the other hand, the woman is convinced by this narrative that she should not consider any adjustments on her side because this is all on him. She addresses issues such as sexism feminism and a working woman\\'s quandary over pursuing your dreams or compromising them for your family, just to name few , with ease. I thought Nancy Meyers ( directer and writer) wrote an incredibly entertaining movie and directed it very well. So, she gave him the least amount of tasks. Surprisingly he catches her attention after he managed to voluntarily arrange a disk that has been always found unarranged. Eventually, his guidance helps her bringing her life together. Remember her since The Princess Diaries times and eventually she is still the same....\\n0 out of 0 found this helpful. Hats off to Nancy Meyers for coming up with such interesting plot and story. However like the proverbial turtle slowly and steadily he manages to win her and everyone\\'s confidence in the office. Intertwined in the drama is her not so happy marriage which she desperately wants to save. Well, the director Nancy Meyers did a great work. She\\'s young and not experienced, he\\'s wise and he has rich background in business. julep\\'s family is about to fall apart, and she thinks, if she hires a new director, her family will be fine again. It\\'s a choice between her work, which is extremely important for her, and her family. What should she do? Can this decision save her relationship with her husband? It\\'s a tough decision, but with bends help she makes a right one. The company is developing rapidly and has many orders and it\\'s ruled by young woman. The movie emphasizes that she has a family, that she is not an arrogant person, and that she doesn\\'t live on the dole. All this suggests that any woman can work hard and support a family, that everyone has equal opportunities, regardless of gender. Separately, it should be noted that in the movie, the heroine\\'s husband is sitting with the child, which also emphasizes equality in determining roles in the family. Moreover she feels guilty about her children and her husband,she pays great attention to her work and focused on her work,she always full of energy and she has pumped up for her job. In conclusion she didn\\'t give up her job in the end and lived well with her husband. I was surprised she didn\\'t engage in sharing the business issues with him as a consequence and so keep him in tow. \"Rene Russo\" shiny and bright in this age, she is really wonderful woman A story is Simple, the decoration of the company so beautiful. The special bonding between a young lady & a (grand) father - figure. Like her, I face the same challenges in a high pressure job. How she tries so hard to make everyone happy to the point of sacrificing her own happiness. The point is, even when a woman is the founder of a company, the \"glass ceiling\" is still there unless she gets the support she deserves and needs in her professional and personal life. One of the more painful results of the story was the emerging of rather important issues of our time (the role of woman in our society, as well as that of the elderly) but completely obliterating the possible emotional impact by having the characters admit their stances (have we never heard of \"show don\\'t tell\"?). She was an owner of a online Amazon-like company. She seemed too rushed and frazzled. (Don\\'t know if that is what she was trying to portray or not) and she seemed a little young for her position. And her employees seemed fresh out of college (or high school) and acted it. Nancy Meyers is a perfect fit in her life for being such talented producer! They see this little friend, she scowls and hides behind her mother. I will never watch one of miss Meyers\\' movies again. The issue which tells us about feminism were packed in a good way. Instead, it\\'s a somewhat sappy (not quite a romantic comedy though) story about the trials of the working professional mother and how wisdom through life experience can be used to improve her life. There are some cringe worthy references to sexism in business thrown in there, and the working mother gets judged by the stay at home moms (who eventually get called out). However, she is not generally presented as a poor oppressed woman in tech, kept down by the evil Patriarchy. Instead, she is presented as someone overwhelmed by her own busy life, but committed to taking responsibility and just needing some guidance. Old man, young businesswoman, she hates him, then slowly starts to like him, cutesy/special friendship forms, he stays at her company forever and ever and so on... She believes that she has to do everything at the company and demands to oversee everything. She eventually accepts him and they become very close friends, to the point that she trusts him with her life. She has a child, and her husband is a stay at home husband who does all the cooking, cleaning, and other familial stuff. Continuing to defy clichés, the boss of this company is a young woman who has a daughter and stay-at-home husband, going against the stereotype that all coo\\'s are Caucasian men with trophy wives. She is a powerful business women that is 18 months into starting her own company. We soon learn that she is not the easiest person to work for. She is strong willed and believes she must do everything within the company to make sure it\\'s done right.',\n",
       " 'review_cluster_2': 'Loved the relationship between the intern and Jules, it made me think of a very proud granddad who tries to help his niece out. If Jules\\' husband was played by some actor with better acting it\\'d have been stellar. The relationship of Jules (Hathaway) and Ben (De Niro) is very admirable. What I didn\\'t like though was when Matt (Jules\\' husband) had an affair and made Jules feel that it was her fault because her company became successful in less than two years. She really is believable as coo Jules often and really excels in the role. Are we surprised to find that Jules\\' home life is burdened by the fact that her husband Matt gave up his career plans to be a stay-at-home dad? Nearly all of Jules and mate\\'s scenes are dedicated to talking about the fact that they never see each other. I liked Jules and Ben but I wanted the movie to clear out the junky plot points and just let them talk, let them be human beings who connected with each other. When he brings it to Jules, the two have a heartfelt conversation that seems to be drawn from the characters, not from the screenplay. Written and directed by Nancy Meyers starring movie veteran icon Robert Deniro as Ben Whittaker coming out of retirement and eventually being accepted as an intern for internet selling sensation coo magnet Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway) One day, he notices her driver is a bit too drunk to drive and he takes his place as Jules driver. Ben starts out as a useless minion to Jules, but over time he evolves into a trusted sidekick. By the end of the film, Ben is arguably Jules equal, and also her mentor. To the extent that Ben and Jules are equals, one could argue that they are buddy heroes who follow the classic pattern of being at odds with each other at first and then grow into off s. Whether Ben is her sidekick, mentor, or buddy is open to interpretation here. He takes Jules daughter to kindergarten and fixes her relationship with her stay-at-home husband. Now, with this new opportunity, he has a chance to pass on his wealth of knowledge not only to Jules, but also to all the members of her staff. Jules wants to be seen as independent and so she resists Ben s help. As you point out, Greg, Ben himself has already accomplished in life many of the goals that Jules is now seeking. The first half of this movie is devoted to Jules not being ready. Thirty or forty years in the future, I can easily envision Jules doing all the things that Ben is doing in this movie. Aside from Jules, all the other characters in the story were caricatures and stereotypes of millennials. I we got a degree in marketing from hazard was was was And of course Ben calms her down with a pat and a hanky - then pushes Jules to delegate some of her authority to Becky. Jules is the female Mark Zuckerberg who needs a nudge to realize that if she s going to play with the big boys, she has to grow a pair. Ben is wise enough to know he needs to come out of retirement to meet his need to mentor, and Jules becomes wise enough to recognize that she needs mentoring. One of Jules employees is also comedic in a pathetic sort of way. I all grant you a nice hero s journey for both Ben and Jules. 30-year-old CEO, Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway) who has grown up her company with more than 200 employees in a year and a half. The founder and coo Jules often (Hathaway Hathaway) is a success driven woman on her early thirties. Jules, with unconventional methods and business vision has driven her once small business, About The Fit, to the top list of fashion commerce sites. The senior man invisibly brings to Jules life, that has been overtaken by fast paced meetings and 14 hour working days, much needed support and calmness. Jules is married to a stay at home dad, with whom she has an adorable 9 year old daughter. On the other hand, Jules(Hathawaye) plHathawayed to hire senior person. Then Ben applied for it and passed it to take charge of Jules. But Jules doesn\\'t like senior person because of her mother. While he was waiting, he cleaned the office up, became a Jules changed her mind to Ben. I watched this movie four times because this is really nice, impressive and inspired Jules who working hard woman. The founder of the company is Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway), a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic. Hathaway costars as Jules, the Founder of the company who at first is reluctant to work with an older crowd, but then takes a genuine liking to Ben as not only a dependable intern, but a father figure. Of course, there are conflicts that are incorporated into the film that causes their relationship some challenges, and Jules\\' own relationship with her husband. While it draws somewhat on stereotypes of both seniors and Millennials, the film presents the characters, especially Jules and Matt, as dimensional, if a little dramatized, people growing and learning in a fast-paced world. Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway): Who said that, you? I could relate to Jules character and desire was a believable and unexpected great mentor. I love how Jules honored his opinion after getting over the initial shock. She tries to be cool and calculated, as per Jules, her character - a self-made internet entrepreneur - but when Jules meets the titular intern, Ben, and lets that bondswoman exterior fall and starts hanging out with her dopey underlings, Hathaway (not the character) tries to be \"one of the boys\" and the performance fails. Enter Jules often (Hathaway Hathaway), successful, confident entrepreneur running a multimillion dollar website/ clothing company. Jules husband, a kind of out of shape former businessman, doesn\\'t seem to care about his wife in his most emotional scene. While Jules isn\\'t initially kicked about the senior internship program, she quickly finds a friend and a mentor in Ben who helps her make decisions personally and professionally. He tells people to be truthful, but then breaks into a house rather than have Jules (Hathaway) talk to her mother. Most of the conflict comes from Jules\\' marriage, and that just shouldn\\'t be the central premise of a film in this day and age, especially when it\\'s tacked on at the end. Delving deep into personal life of Jules there is much to see and help with and the pair build up a friendship. The chemistry between he (Ben) and Hathawaye Hathaway \"Jules\" was dynamic and most enjoyable. I would give Ben and Jules) an A+. The way Jules took her husband\\'s infidelity, Ben so orderly and impeccable. - mason (funny man madam device from Pitch Perfect ) Things to look for: · In the beginning of the movie when Jules rides her bicycle through the office, they had to have her ride extra slowly so the two girls could get all of their lines out during the scene. · Jules and Ben watch the movie An america in parts , which your kids probably haven\\'t seen. Is Jules going to run her dreams by saying no to a coo or stays back and let a coo in. As an audience you feel saying it in the very beginning of the movie itself like \"Come on Jules you can do it ! Revealing it to Jules and might have had egregious consequences in her life. But when Jules finds it out, he was there to listen and talk with her. Even when Jules stopped by his home in the end of the movie - he delivers his thought on why she should run a company in a pleasing way stating you might have taken that decision by now but you stopped by here to see me to get an assertion that you are making the right decision. Few would have advised the moment they over heard the conversation Jules had in conference room. A large hole remained in Jules\\' relationship with her mother, which was brought up multiple times but never resolved. Ben gets paired with Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway), the busy founder of About the Fit who barely has anytime to even eat. Jules is a very independent, self made women who believes an intern can only be a distraction. Just like Ben, I really cared about Jules and wanted her to be happy. We were able to follow Ben and Jules morning, afternoon, and night. Inexplicably, the plot shifts focus from desirous Ben to Hathawaya Hathaway Jules midway through and never looks back. In one scene, Matt, page, Jules, and Ben are in the stinks kitchen when page tells her parents that daddy doesn\\'t want to be her friend anymore and Matt calls daddy bipolar on account of the fact that every other day she is has an issue with page. desire is relegated to playing a many Worth character who offers fatherly comfort to a driven entrepeneur. Jules, reluctant at first to have an older intern, will find in Ben a valuable ally for his projects and a loyal friend. I was disappointed in the end--it seems to me that Jules was just as responsible as Matt for their troubles and that didn\\'t seem to be acknowledged enough. Also, the awkward way the The Intern had Jules (Hathaway) deal with Ben (Deniro) was a snag in the movie. He effortlessly makes friends of everyone in Jules\\' office and knows exactly what everyone needs. At one point of the movie, Jules (Hathaway) asks Ben (De Niro), \"Why do you always say the perfect thing?\" The overworked self-made women (Jules) doesn\\'t have time for anyone, especially herself, as she tries to keep her company running. Sure, in the context of Jules\\' life, it\\'s important. Moreover, the film has to ignore class conflict in the just century in order to make Jules\\' problems at all dramatic. As time marches on, Deniro Ben and Hathaway Jules form a wonderful kinship. i really enjoyed the love-hate, father/daughter type chemistry between Jules and Ben, as they try and better each other\\'s lives one awkward situation at a time. desire plays Ben and he\\'s just Jules\\' lackey for most of the movie. He has some great scenes but he\\'s mostly there to make Jules feel better about herself. Jules has a successful startup company, a loving and supportive husband and a beautiful daughter but her commitment to her career results in problems at home. In doctor founder Jules, however, we get a mega successful glass ceiling-breaking online store founder who\\'s got a family to boot. You come to love Jules, just as you do the title character. He eventually gets the job, and meets the owner of the company Jules. Jules is a young but busy women running a company by herself, and she has a family which her stay at home husband runs. The senior intern program was her idea, but Jules is initially hesitant to deal with Ben personally on a daily basis. After a little awkwardness as Ben and Jules both try to figure out how he can best serve his new boss, he ends up becoming her driver. In this capacity, he gets to know Jules\\' stay-at-home husband (Anders Holm), their precocious, but adorable young daughter (JoJo Kushner) and, most importantly, Jules herself, in all her earnestness, anxiety and vulnerability. It turns out that, at this stage of the game, Jules needs bends wisdom and support more than she\\'d be willing to admit - to him or herself. In the midst of all this, Ben becomes a sounding board and occasional advice dispenser for Jules, a very helpful coworker and kind of pseudo uncle to a small group of the company\\'s young employees (played by madam DeVine, Zack Pearlman, Jason orle and christian Scherer) and a possible love interest for the company\\'s full-time in-house masseuse (Rene Russo). Jules is simply a modern woman who\\'s very likeable and subtly inspiring. A scene in which some of Jules\\' employees break the law to help her with a pressing personal problem is fun, but seems misplaced, and the resolutions to some of the story\\'s conflicts seem a little trite, but, overall, this is simply a delightful film that it\\'d recommend to anyone. Well, no one knows, really, least of all the founder and CEO of the company, 30-ish Jules - played by Hathawaye Hathaway (\"Interstellar\") with her usual spunk - but Ben is assigned to her, anyway. She ignores him, until Ben makes himself so indispensable to the entire office (he\\'s that just that kind of guy) that she just has to take notice, and before long he is driving her to and from work, watching her kid, and spending time in her (amazing) Brooklyn brownstone\\xa0with house-husband (sorry, \"stay-at-home dad,\" as Jules corrects Ben) Matt - a very forgettable Anders Holm (\"Unexpected\"). And why does Jules - successful internet mogul that she is - need and respond to this new older masculine presence? Jules is a representation of the new age entrepreneurial business kicksorters who are admired today. These include rent Russo (Thor) as the flirtatious maseus, Nat wolf (Paper Towns) as a manager, madam device (Pitch Perfect) as an outgoing fellow intern who, like in all his other roles, needs to imporve his social skills, each Pearlman, Andrew RHathawayells as Jules\\' assistant, and Christina Scherer as Jules\\' secretary. Ben, Jules, and the others care for each other. It demonstrates the value of experience, management, passion, leadership, wit, and carrying a hankerchief (as well as blinking - \"Jules hates it when people don\\'t blink\"). Brilliant movie, funny and touching in places with what Jules had to face in her life.. Jules is an every day busy businesswoman, she is always focused on her work, and tidy when it comes to plHathawaying, and having everything done the way she wants it too. Jules is also trying to maintain her personal life with her daughter and husband Matt. Ben assist Jules in her every day work by driving her around, giving advice, and life experience lessons, and also trying to help her out with her daughter. When Jules is coming across a breaking point of wanting another coo to take charge of her company that she started. Jules struggles can be predictable, and the film easily shows that every challenge she is going through will easily be handled. Jules personal life that she rarely has with her husband and daughter does open the room that her marriage is not exactly healthy. When her husband is having an affair, as Jules is almost non existent. Jules is under pressure, the challenges are not really much of a struggle when solutions were easily given. He arrives amid a tornado that is the companies founder/owner Jules often (Hathaway Hathaway) and as her personal assistant they both build a close relationship. Eventually, Jules comes to like Ben and she let\\'s him become her chauffeur. Jules is married to her stay-at-home husband, Matt (Anders Holm) and has a little daughter named Paige (JoJo Kushner). It all indicates that Matt can\\'t hold on to his marriage because Jules is absent all the time due to her being CEO. The unexpected thing is that in the end Ben surprises everyone and manages not only to improve the business, but also gives Jules a valuable lesson. In contrast, Jules who seems to have everything under control is an illusion, as having this successful business does not have the time to be with his family and be an attentive mother and wife. As said, wanders Holm doesn\\'t have the same enthusiasm as the rest of the cast and gets lost amidst everything else which does hurt Jules\\' character arc when she has such a dullard of a spouse. On one hand is Deniro\\'s 70-year-old Ben Whittaker, presently struggling to deal with the concept of retirement; on the other is Hathawaye Hathaway 32-year-old Jules Ostin, the founder and coo of a tremendously successful fashion-based commerce company called \\'About the Fit\\' or \\'ATF\\' for short\\' who is presently struggling to deal with the demands of her investors while not neglecting her six-year-old daughter and stay- home husband. Despite Jules\\' initial chagrin, that same executive assigns Ben directly to Jules in order to set an example for the rest of the employees in the company. In keeping with her recent movies, meters has eschewed male- dominated Hollywood stereotype by fashioning Jules as a strong, opinionated and successful female individual who can be a hands-on CEO to over 220 employees at her company while being a dedicated mother and loving wife. You can almost hear Meyers\\' own lament through Jules that the men of today are a far cry from the likes of Jack Nicholson and garrison Ford, and that just as Jules does, we will find something to learn from the silver-haired members of our workforce. meters tries to convey the latter first, and does so quite persuasively through a mixture of situational comedy and punchlines that are gently amusing but never by way of caricature – indeed, the closest she comes to farce is an \\'Oceans\\' Eleven\\' like \\'heist\\' led by Ben to break into Jules\\' mother\\'s house and delete an email that Jules had accidentally sent to her mother. Not to trivialize women in similar predicaments, but it isn\\'t quite so convincing just why Jules\\' husband would cheat on her in the first place and a tad too convenient how Ben comes to chance upon the fact which ends up putting him in a moral quandary. Jules is the protagonist, but I guess the director did not know that fact. He was supposed to be a down to earth, calm, wise man who would know better that Jules talking to her mother and explaining her feelings would be better than doing an illegal break in a mother\\'s home. His boss is the positive, but still intimidating Jules often (played by Hathawaye Hathaway) who find that Ben has been assigned to her. Only when her chauffeur becomes drunk and Ben takes over that Jules starts to warm up. Jules in informed by her board that she should find someone else to act as C.E.O. Ben does his best to help Jules while she contemplates her decision. It turns out that, at this stage of the game, Jules needs bends wisdom and support more than she\\'d be willing to admit – to him or herself. Jules is simply a modern woman who\\'s very likable and subtly inspiring. In addition to being a Type A driven and obsessed with details company leader (the type that rides her bike through the office to save time), Jules also has a husband, a young daughter and a fabulous brownstone. At the same time Ben arrives on the scene, Jules is struggling with her investors\\' decision to hire a more experienced coo so that the company can maintain its phenomenal growth. Jules initially spurns Ben, but of course, he soon becomes invaluable around the office, and while blinking his eyes, becomes her most valued confidant and adviser. For example, the conflict between Jules and her husband occurs in a hotel room, which would be fine except _x0085_ only one of them is there! The final thirty minutes are taken up with her tears, Ben being the understanding grandfatherly advice type, and Jules husband making an ass of himself. In the character development of Jules it\\'s pointed out in a big business article that she does something on a bicycle in the office. In one hilarious scene, Jules realizes she has sent the wrong email to her mother (one in which she refers to her mother as a terrorist), and Ben leads the reconnaissance mission to delete the email. Jules\\' daughter is played by JoJo Kushner, a gorgeous child. As Jules\\' husband, wanders Holm can show different feelings just by his facial expression. Why should we remotely care about Hathawaye Hathaway character, \"Jules\"? But, no, if they did that, they wouldn\\'t have the next big trauma in Jules\\' life: Hubby is having an affair_x0085_ and he\\'s found out by Bobby! Who fell in love with one woman, married her, outlived her, and is doing nothing of value until he becomes Jules\\' slave boy, page\\'s new BFF, and the Morality Police, making it his business to call Jules\\' hubby out on the carpet! Or_x0085_ does he leave them on the floor hoping that Jules will trip over them, stumble and fall into a coma, so he can carry on his \"affair\" with a woman whose face we never see? Next: The pathetic scene of Matt trying to \"make up\" for his \"indiscretion\" and \"reconnect\" with Jules at the end. Nancy does a close-up of his hand_x0085_ no_x0085_ FINGERS_x0085_ reaching for Jules\\' fingers_x0085_ and Jules BARELY responds. Jules and Matt are back together, everybody! In the beginning you pity the 70-year-old retired and widowed Ben for being slightly neglected or ill-treated by the workaholic, passionate, never tiring, ambitious and successful Jules, but that is short lived and He wins her confidence and heart in a couple of days. A pinch of comedy here and there adds up to the fun content, and a few personal life tensions of Jules balances it very beautifully and how She comes out of it is remarkable and worth taking lessons from. Ben ends up chauffeuring for Jules and later he shares a tasters choice moment in which he tells Jules the building they work in is the same one he worked in for 40 years. Have a great wedding,\" says Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway) and \"You\\'re calling me \\'Ace?\\' That\\'s like super cool,\" Jules to Ben (Robert De Niro.) At first, no one, including Jules, knew how to take him, but good one Ben, unintentionally became the star, friend and mentor to everyone there. Remarkably, the voice-over is revealed to be a video pitch, as Ben is applying to a Senior Citizen intern program at About the Fit, an online fashion startup founded and run by Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway), a thirtyish bundle of energy whose workaholic ways jeopardize her family life at home (consisting of a husband and very cute young daughter). Just as the young employees at the startup warm up to Ben, who is at heart a good guy, Jules at her core is also quite sweet. This occurs when Jules promises a customer that she\\'ll personally call the vendor who screwed up an order involving bridal gowns, have the gowns sent in time for the wedding and then refund the customer\\'s money. When Ben is assigned to be Jules\\' personal intern, this gives him an opportunity to play the part of mentor (or father figure) to Jules and become (as he puts it during the initial narration) \"whole again.\" When he spies Jules\\' chauffeur drinking on the job, he orders him not to drive her, thus saving her from harm. In an even more telling moment during the first half of the second act, Jules asks one of her aides to have Ben transferred because she fears he\\'s \"too observant.\" Jules fears intimacy and hides under the mask of the driven boss. We might conclude that Jules too has experienced a loss and, like Ben, seeks to become \"whole.\" Ben, along with some of Jules\\'s employees, break into Jules\\'s parents\\' home, in order to delete a rather nasty and embarrassing email inadvertently sent by Jules to her mother by accident. Jules is also aware of the affair and Ben helps Jules cope with the crisis in a frank but reassuring talk while on a business trip to San Francisco. On the \"road back,\" Jules must not only resolve the problem with her husband but decide whether to hire a coo to replace her, which the investors of the company have been clamoring for. The marital discord is resolved when julep\\'s husband unexpectedly shows up at the office and has a heart to heart begging forgiveness (Jules is more than willing to forgive him). Again it\\'s bends wise counsel that convinces Jules not to let the company be taken over by an outsider and potentially ruin everything she\\'s achieved. He not only finds \"wholeness\" helping Jules and her employees but finds love with the startup\\'s in-house masseuse (Rene Russo). There is a telling shot towards the beginning of The Intern, where Ben is waiting for hours to see Jules and it\\'s rather sad how he\\'s all alone, and his adventure really hasn\\'t begun. But after Jules has resolved her situation, Ben realizes that his time at the firm is up and he\\'s accomplished all that he wanted to do. The company has grown to the extent that Jules is overworked and overstressed, and spends insufficient time with her young daughter and husband. Instead, what we have is a gentle – and rather unsurprising – drama, with some amusing moments, and likable performances from all concerned, with desire unusually playing a character who is really rather ordinary (apart from a touch of old which, together with several other plot threads – Jules\\' mother, an office romance – goes unexplored). So Ben appreciates the old feminism as well as the new that he sees in Jules (a man\\'s name feminized by its homonym Jewels). As Jules notes, \"It\\'s 2015, are we really still critical of working moms?\" De Niro could be on the list of old actors that Jules cites as the lost generation of Men: Harrison Ford, Jack Nicholson. The husband had a brilliant career ahead of him, prioritized Jules\\'s to become a stay-at-home father, then slips into the tired old cliché of adulterer. The fashion website is founded & run by, Jules Ostin(Hathawaye Hathaway). The movie was flawless, feel good time, inspiring and motivational for start up, youngster and old a like\\n\\nThe chemistry bond between Ben and Jules were uncHathawayy\\n\\nEveryone played their part so well with the script and direction too\\n\\nWhy I did not gave the movie 10 stars is because of the ending which I prefer Jules to have hired the coo on the point of view to ease up her work load and to expand her business. Hathawaye Hathaway plays JulesOstin, CEO of the company who reluctantly gets paired with Ben. And the subplot of Jules (Hathaway) trying to find balance at home...by the looks of it, her husband didn\\'t HAVE TO be a stay-at-home dad. I liked the way the scenes after Ben sees Jules husband Matt with another woman are handled. He was excellent as Jules friend and manager.Some scenes involving Jason (Adam DeVine) needed editing. Nice to see Ben see things Jules way. The affability and helpfulness is the key of the character Ben and there is a lot of inter- generational exchange and Jules,the heavily burdened career oriented woman, at one point of time helps him to make casebook account. meter\\'s articulate direction has succeeded in making Ben winning the trust of Jules to the extent, she discusses her husband\\'s extra- marital relationship and the Man fridge reunited them . Ben (De Niro) and Jules (Hathaway) are characters who have morals and qualities fans of all ages will love, such as diligence, compassion, and rationality that many comedy/drama characters lack. Jules characteristics are meant to be empowering, breaking the traditional stay at home mom role and portraying women kicking modern day business in the can. She covers the emotional spectrum and manages to sell the pain and pressure that Jules suffers from. The founder of the company is Jules Ostin, a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic. Ben shadows the founder of the company Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway) who is a workaholic and trying to balance work and family life. Suddenly he is an asset to the other interns who find his life experience valuable and also to Jules who after her initial hesitation finds him someone she can rely on. Still the ending bothered me somehow - does someone find it truly realistic that Jules\\' husband suddenly realizes how wrong his behavior was and all his feelings leading to this behavior disappear? This film proves how political correctness can damage a movie - everyone is so psychotically pleasant, not to mention Jules stay-at-home husband and an adorable daughter in addition to a stimulating career. And everybody seems to love him there, but will his uptight boss named Jules(Hathawaye Hathaway) ever grow to like him? Jules is married to a stay at home dad (Anders Holm) and has a spunky child, but her work seems to take precedence – until the concept of a senior intern is forced upon her. Jules is very much \"work focused\" and has zero balance in her life. Ben and Jules have no real conflicts or disagreements. It would have been nice if desirous Ben had some flaws or shortcomings that Jules could have seen as well as all the great qualities as well. It also would have been nice if Jules had to make some hard decisions or sacrifices to grow her business. Upon getting the job, he accepts a position as the intern for Jules, even though she states that she will have little for him to do. As a result, Ben begins helping around the office and eventually catches the eye of Jules, who notices his outgoing, selfless personality, his gentlemanly ways, and his talents as an everyman. With that, Jules begins using him as her driver and an assistant scheduler, but despite this, Jules is juggling an immense amount of responsibilities. Jules, who is also a wife and mother of a young girl, is told by one of her assistant mangers that they are thinking of bringing in a coo to help Jules make managerial decisions and run the company, something she fears will rob her company of its core ideology and grassroots plan. Stressed and out of options, Jules utilizes bends versatile traits to help her in a time of need, and the two strike an amiable chemistry. Consider the scene in a bar, which has been shortened to the scene of Jules questioning her employees about how, in the span of one generation, men have gone from guys like Jack Nicholson and garrison Ford to \"boys,\" as she puts it, in the trailer. I found the scene trivial and grating in the trailer, because the same argument could be made for women in a different light, but upon seeing the entire film, or the entire scene for that matter, Jules brings up an interesting observation about men and women in the current generation. But he\\'s highly intelligent, experienced, wise, cautious, persuasive, somewhat charismatic, astute, etc., etc., etc., and has a lot to offer to Hathawaye Hathaway\\'s Jules, a hard-driven entrepreneur who is in over her head as a victim of her own success. His reward is apparently for Jules to decide she wants to keep him on as an unpaid intern. Jules must overcome various challenges. The subplot adds nothing to the story and seems to be there only as an excuse to avoid any romance between Ben and Jules (Hathaway (33)). Meanwhile, Jules\\'s stay-at-home husband has a dalliance with a girl who has about as much screen presence as SuzHathawaye Somers in \"American Graffitti.\" mate\\'s inamorata could have been fleshed out to give Jules some actual competition, raise the stakes and require her to develop as a person to overcome the challenge. They could have pushed the envelope a little with Jules pursuing a measure of revenge on Matt through a liaison with Ben. At first, he couldn\\'t look more out of place in the modern open plan, teach savvy work place he now occupies, but his old school ways eventually endear him to his to workers, as well as Jules herself, until Ben becomes her driver and she finds his age and wisdom coming to save her in her personal as well as professional life. Because it isn\\'t as much about the intern Ben Wittacker himself (Robert Deniro), as it is more about Jules often (Hathawaye Hatheway), and the role of men and women in modern society. Pivotal in this was the scene in the bar where Jules makes the observation that girls become women, but somewhere along the line men became boys. Furthermore; the relation between Ben and Jules; from scene one it was clear that Ben wouldn\\'t do much growing, or have a huge story-arc in this movie; he was the mentor for the group of people from the get go. The real growing was done by Jules (and in lesser part by the staff surrounding her), but this part was the most disappointing for me because (SPOILER AHEAD) she forgave her husband for cheating on her (bullshit about feeling emasculated and so on). For example, Jules has sent an email accidentally to her mother. Jules is involved in creating \\'ideal\\' for people to attire themselves in; this occurs in the opening scene about an ill fitting bridal gown. And Jules attempts to fix, to fulfill this \\'ideal form\\'. Ben ingratiates himself with Jules\\' family. There\\'s an almost-interesting subplot about Jules being asked to hire a new, more seasoned coo to be her boss by the venture capital company that funds her company. There\\'s a list of 10 potential CEOs, but Jules only interviews 3 of them (all off-camera). There\\'s another subplot with Jules\\' husband that was only a surprise if you\\'ve never seen any movie before. His boss, Jules, is a workaholic who forgets to sleep, eat and have fun. Despite the lack of action, deep drama and pressing moments, apart from the hilarious scene where Ben and some boys try to break into Jules\\' mother\\'s home to delete an insulting message on her computer, the film was lovely, easy to watch and uplifting. Hathawaye Hathaway plays Jules, the entrepreneur/working mom, who is way in over her head with her job. They worked as good comedy relief and added to the uniqueness of Jules and bends relationship. Is he secretly in love with Jules? Sexual mention between Ben and Jules. When they go to the trip together and they are in the hotel room, Jules offers Ben to lay down in the bed and she says \"Don\\'t worry it\\'ll sit on the couch\". To the point it gave me the impression that page\\'s friend was the daughter of one of the moms that criticizes Jules. But instead of trying to push how Strong and independent woman Jules is, they would\\'ve made Ben comment about parent influence their child to not be friends with paige. Jules is impersonal and demanding, again, in a very believable way. I wish the script had been as interesting and believable in its development of Jules as it was with Ben. Jules is married to Matt (Anders Holm). I just didn\\'t want Jules, this brilliant, talented, interesting woman, to be married to Matt. The conflict in this film is all reserved for Hathawaye Hathaway Jules, the founder of the company who gets stuck with Ben as her personal intern/assistant and treats him coldly until she, like the rest of us, realizes how amazing he is. Deniro\\'s 70 or old intern Ben and Hathawaya Hathaway user busy company owner Jules are great together and the coworkers at Jules\\' company are very good as they all learn from and grow fonder and fonder of De Niro. We think he and Jules will rub each other the wrong way and hold the key to each others\\' happiness just out of reach, but Ben remains a capable support for Jules as she slowly figures out several of the issues she\\'s dealing with. It stars two Academy Award winners--Hathawaye Hathaway as Jules, the president of a large and successful fashion company, and Robert De Niro as Ben, who, at age 70, decides to intern at Jules\\' firm. Somewhere else is Jules whining and dithering over whether to hire a coo in order to save her marriage. Jules Ortin (Hathawaye Hathaway) the brainchild and the owner of the line is assigned Ben as her intern. Jules instantaneously is overwhelmed with a feeling of violation as the veteran comes across as too calm and too observant – something Jules is unable to neither fathom nor react to. Jules on her own is an individual who most certainly has too much on her plate. The 120 minute long comedy solely rides on the shoulders of Ben and Jules. Later he sees something he should not have seen and should he tell Jules? Jules is a workaholic and she ends up using Ben as a calming influence.. I expected Ben to use his business experience to help Jules find her way. The company\\'s led by Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway) who\\'s so busy that she\\'s persuaded to scour for a new CEO. Jules agrees to interview several candidates. Meanwhile, Ben, being an intern to Jules, doesn\\'t have a lot to do, but soon finds himself becoming a mentor and a friend of sorts to Jules and aids her in overcoming not just the crises at work, but those at home as well. Coming into this new job, his mentor is Jules, who is not too thrilled to have him working for her. Heartwarming but poor ending This film was an easy to watch, heartwarming story... until the last 15 minutes which were poor, weakened Jules character and made little sense That young lady is Hathaway as Jules. Jules and Ben become a team, he even becomes her driver, he gets to know her family, and eventually he becomes the substitute dad Jules needs. As an interesting aside, it turns out that Jules\\' company is occupying the same building, the same space that Ben worked in for about 40 years. The founder of the company Jules, is a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic. The narrative should have had Jules depicted as a very cold, unapproachable person who gradually warms to Ben halfway through the second act, this is how these films usually work. The \"heist\" scene--you build Jules\\' character into this hard working woman, and suggest she\\'d reach out to her team to help with such a ridiculous problem..It seemed like at some point the writer decided that we needed adventure and threw this in because that\\'s all she had. Then he works his way into life with the CEO Jules played excellently by Hathawaye Hathaway. Ben works on helping Jules sort out her business life and her personal life which are totally modern dynamic in different ways. What this script does use effectively besides subtle humor, is the way the characters backgrounds are filled in, particularly Ben and Jules, as the film moves along. Plus, Jules is never seen having any other friends, implying that a successful woman can\\'t have a personal life. Let\\'s get back to the story: Jules is the founder and manager of a clothes\\' online selling company, she\\'s in her early thirties and tries to combine her private life (married with a child) and her time-demanding business. That\\'s it, Jules is reluctant first but progressively, the help of Ben gets more and more precious and their professional bond develops into a genuine friendship that slowly transcend their generation gap. This is a character-driven story without any twists or tricky situations of misunderstanding, and that the screenplay had the guts to avoid any artificial devices to make the story move forward (I expected at some part that Jules\\' assistant will turn into a villain) and keep on the same level of sweetness between the characters is a stunt I admire, it doesn\\'t take risks, but that\\'s a risk in itself. First, Jules is totally aware that she\\'s successful but listen to her speech during a party, the way she blames boys for not being enough of men, how we came to manhood models like garrison Ford to geeky wussies is the trigger of her anger towards men. And this is why Ben is sincere when he tells Jules that she\\'s got nothing to sacrifice just to please her cheating husband or her employees, he doesn\\'t see her as a woman but as a person who achieved something worthy of admiration. Hathaway stars as Jules, a young woman who runs a successful internet sales company that she started from scratch. He\\'s assigned to work with the company\\'s \\'work obsessed\\' CEO, named Jules often (Hathaway). Everyone that works with Ben, immediately takes a liking to him; except Jules, who he initially Hathawayoys. The interpretations of Deniro who played as Ben, rent runs who played as find and Hathaway who played as Jules were also very good. When he is chosen is is very excited, but when he meets the owner, Jules (Hathaway) his excitement begins to waver. Ben has been around long enough though and slowly he helps Jules not only with her company, but her life as well. But his ethics are tested when he learns a secret about Jules\\' husband that could send her into a tailspin, and her website under. the model of gentleman The main characters are Ben and Jules. He is assigned to under direct to Jules, the coo of company. Gradually, people around him like him, also Jules gets to like and believe him because of his character. Also, Jules has a problem about family, so Ben becomes a good adviser. Hathaway (The Princess Diaries) plays Jules, the company\\'s coo and founder who struggles with work and tries to spend time with her husband, Matt (Holm) and their young daughter. At first, Jules is a bit uncomfortable with Ben, but soon bonds with him and he helps her with her priorities. Founder and coo Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway) has her doubts about her new \\'applicant\\' in the early stages and considers getting him transferred to another department. However, she soon starts to learn that Ben is not only a good worker, but that he\\'s also an excellent \\'life-coach\\' whom Jules finds invaluable both as an employee and as a friend as well. I think the thing that I liked the most about this film is that it felt more like a character study on Jules\\' behalf with Ben kind of being written around her character. The film for me was a minor triumph because I found Jules to be a strong believable character and found her easy to identify with. Ben, to me, felt like the piece that was missing in Jules\\' life; he\\'s an old wise owl who probably doesn\\'t know an pod from an Ipad, but he\\'s lived and he\\'s more often than not on hand to chip in advice from time to time and at times he does make Jules see things from an alternative perspective. Whilst I did appreciate the warm bond that developed between Jules and Ben and I found Ben to be endearing, kind and likable I didn\\'t find his character quite as believable as Jules; he came across as being a bit too nice and a bit too good to be true and some scenes in the film that bring him closer to Jules seem a little contrived; such as looking out of the window and seeing her driver swigging some alcohol and driving past and seeing Jules\\' husband having an affair with another woman. The bond that develops between Jules and Ben is quite heartwarming and even though much of it is predictable and elements of the story are a tad contrived it\\'s a film that\\'s very hard not to like. The agency hires him and his position will be assistant to the young founder and director Jules often (Hathaway). The story keeps telling us how Ben develops at the work, how difficult is for him to adapt to a new age of young workers, how traditional he is but at the same time the energy he has and how much he wants to learn about everyone and help in anyway he can; the film also show us how free is Jules for work, how dedicated she is and passionate are for the agency that she created. The film show us how the relationship between Jules and Ben develops, how little by little they started to connect as friends, as coworkers . The criticism of wanders hole\\'s casting seems valid, as he was irritating, and makes one wonder what Jules ever saw in him. In this case, the female point of view is that of start up founder Jules (a delightful Hathawaye Hathaway) who is struggling to have it all: a demanding job, a loving husband, and a delightful daughter (something\\'s gotta give). As well as her usual themes, dyers plays with some inter-generational issues especially around technology and work-life balance, in a work that is light but made by two eminently watchable leads (Jules has some great clothes and Ben is rarely out of a suit and tie). Jules is played in a winning performance by Hathaway – the sort that Meg ran used to revel in. Jules often has built a business from scratch and now employs 250 people, but it has entailed sacrifice; she is basically a very nice person whose success has far outstripped her readiness for it. Also joining in on the fun is rent runs as a masseuse (and love interest for desire and drew runnels as Jules\\' ass\\'t. Jules grew because through her relationship with Ben, things that she was feeling but had not admitted to herself became clear. Ben lands the position, and ends up working directly with the female owner, the hurried, entrepreneurial Jules (Hathaway). Jules\\' stay-at-home-dad husband, Matt, looks the part of the hipster sub culture, is soft-spoken, but very competent and busy as a parent. He notices Jules\\' driver swigging liquor from a bottle wrapped in a paper bag. The man says he doesn\\'t know what Ben is talking about, but eventually acquiesces, telling Jules that he doesn\\'t feel good. One day while Ben is driving Jules and mate\\'s daughter around, he notices Matt entering a vehicle and kissing another woman. When Jules finds out, she is saddened, hoping that mate\\'s affairs were over. Later, Matt shows up at Jules\\' work and tells her not to make the step of getting a coo because of her worry of infidelity on his part. He steadfastly argues that his infidelity is over, and that Jules should make her decision with her gut instinct. bends traditional dress, chivalry, and masculinity brings something to the table, so to speak, and Jules shows Ben some the benefits of modern technology. Cinematography is really nice and everything looks like a perfect comedy with a nice message...\\n\\nThat is until we meet Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway\\'s) husband. As fate would have it, he becomes the intern of the company\\'s founder and executor, Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway). No real Jules are broken, no one comes up against a real heartache, everyone gets to be a hero, the mistakes made are cautiously hedged, the antagonists are dogs with rubber teeth, and the whole enterprise is swathed in a comforting blanket of by-the-yard innocuous teasing-the-ears-of-absolutely-no-one sonic wallpaper background music. Despite the skepticism of the company\\'s founder and CEO, Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway), bends wisdom, experience, and genuine desire to contribute make him an invaluable asset to the team. As Ben settles into his role as an intern, he forms an unlikely bond with Jules, who is juggling the demands of her successful business and her personal life. The narrative explores the challenges faced by both Ben and Jules, offering insights into the struggles and triumphs of different stages of life. Their performances add layers of humor and warmth to the film, complementing the central relationship between Ben and Jules. Enter Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway) as the coo of a startup clothing company. Can he save Jules from herself? My only complaint is casting in the form of Jules\\' husband. Ben may have told Jules that she had something many people don\\'t, that is big beautiful and exciting, and though he is right, what he has however, is something way bigger and far more satisfying; Ben had a full life, and that, is something even less people will ever get to experience. My only quibble with the movie was that the main problem of overloaded micromanaging Jules was not fixed, only calmed by bends presence. Then we have a contrasting character like Jules, who is very busy and doesn\\'t have the time for almost anything (today\\'s working women). Also we get a sneak peek into Jules\\' home where she has a husband and daughter, for who she feels she is giving less time due to her job. Another thing was the office people helping Jules in one scene of a mistake made by her. Favorite Scene: I guess it would be where Jules helps Ben open up a casebook account. And Ben in turn tells Jules about his work. Still, at least at first, he can\\'t seem to connect with About the Fit\\'s founder and CEO Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway). Still, bends work ethic and commitment make an impression on Jules as he becomes not only a reliable, valuable work consultant, but also fatherly \"life\" consultant. Jules is the true \"intern\", but in life and love. Both page and Matt crave attention that Jules has no time to give, and Matt may be, shall we say, looking elsewhere to get it. The demands of work and family are causing unbelievable stress and Jules is even thinking of ceding business control to someone else. We are all interns in life and love at one time or another, and it was gratifying to see Ben use what he learned from his \"life internship\" to help Jules deal with her own. So with the script as we know it now, with some fun, little bit hysterical humour, the character of Jules often would have had some more emotion and depth. The Jules often character stayed too clean, too perfect. I think originally the 70 year old intern Ben and the 20 something Jules often were meant to have had an affair and even a sexual fling in San Francisco after drinking some more alcohol in the hotel room from the mini bar (both already having had quite some wine in first class on the airplane on their way to SF). I can feel Ben (De Niro\\'s character) slowly becoming some kind of a father figure for Jules (Hathaway character). One of which is the relationship between Jules and her parents. I just feel a little closure on that would be amazing for Jules\\' character arc. The relationship that develops between Ben and Jules (Hathaway) is beautifully done, and it proves that even in the modern day, a close relationship doesn\\'t have to be sexual in any way..., and it teaches people, especially modern people how to actually earn respect and organically grow a non-sexual relationship over a period of time, and proves that everything isn\\'t instant gratification and you have to work at things, regardless of how old you are. The movie is about how he gets close to Jules and helps her both professionally and personally. Slowly they warm to each other, and Ben, being the perfect gentleman that he is, gets Jules to open up to him in ways that she wouldn\\'t with other employees. Ben soon becomes popular with his younger co-workers, including Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway), the boss and founder of the company. whittler\\'s charm, wisdom and sense of humor help him develop a special bond and growing friendship with Jules. This character he portrays gives advice to his boss Jules Ostin, who has to juggle the work that comes with being CEO, and the compassion and support she has to provide as a mother and a wife. Fiona, Ben, and Jules shine on screen, each bringing a unique charm to the narrative. bends charm, wisdom, and sense of humor help him to quickly develop a special bond and growing friendship with Jules. This is done through his interactions with his fellow co-workers including Jason (Adam Devine), Davis (Zack Pearlman), and Lewis (Jason Orley) and with Jules and her family including her husband Matt (Anders Holm) and her daughter Paige (JoJo Kushner). I loved how Jules marriage turned out not to be the perfect one that we first thought (even tho in the end it goes back to perfect). Another thing that I loved is that the movie also dealt a bit with forgiveness and understanding (when Jules forgives and tries to understand her husband\\'s affair). Character analysis: Jules character was deep, lovable and quite real. One thing however, i though that Ben was gonna become the coo so that Jules can still run the company without an outsider given her orders. What bothered me was the ending where Jules ignored bends advice and gave her philandering husband another chance. I couldn\\'t see why Jules married him except that she talked him up during their early marriage days. My only problem would be that some of the actors, Jules husband are very weak. So sweet it will make your teeth hurt Jules often runs a successful internet fashion start-up, but she has trouble combining business with her family live. While Jules is not so quick to appreciate Ben - or the program in general - she eventually warms up to him and the idea. The two form a strong bond, and Jules comes to see Ben, not only as an asset, but a close and trustworthy friend. There is an especially uncomfortable (at first) yet heartwarming scene, where Jules invites Ben to lay down in her bed late one night on a business trip. Every plot twist, is barely a twist at all, and often predictable (oh look, Jules\\' apparently-perfect-at- being-a-house-husband husband Matt is having and affair, and Ben finds out completely by accident by just happening to turn down the road where Matt has just met up with his mistress)\\n\\nBut you know, many people like exactly that kind of movie, and this is a well made example of the genre. I really appreciated watching the relationship develop between Jules and Ben which were wonderfully acted by Robert De Nero and Hathawaye Hathaway. It was hard to locate one person of either African or Latino descent acting as a teach professional at Jules\\' company, yet when she visits the company warehouse to speak to the packers (a job that presumably does not required a college education) there is where we find our first extras of color. He is assigned to the company\\'s boss Jules Ostin, played by the beautiful Hathawaya Hathaway, and from that moment on we embark on a journey where we get to know the characters. The main characters Ben and Jules are portrait in a likable almost natural way, with moments that will evoke happiness and sadness. Jules on the other side, a classy, perfect,confident 21st Century girl who passionately runs the firm she started maintaining a work life balance. I must admit I wanted Ben to have more impact at the company - maybe be in an \\'equally shared role\\' CEO with Jules?. Hathawaye Hathaway stands out as Jules often in her character\\'s multidimensional abilities: wife/mother/businesswoman/CEO. He is old-fashioned but become loved by every co-workers Jules, Hathawaye Hathaway, is a entrepreneur and a mother. It is pathetic that Jules is looked coldly by other mothers. It also feels like a flawless character Ben walks into Jules life and somewhat fixes everything about her and her situations. I was hoping for a deeper dive and clash between the two different generations (also no bushbuck when Jules gets drunk and dunks on the boys)\\n\\nEither all its inoffensive and a fine family movie for all. So when I watched Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker trying to make himself useful as an intern at About The Fit, a startup sensation, an commerce company founded by Jules (Hathawaye Hathway), by helping the delivery lady, by coming in at 7am to clear a table that was unofficially the dustbin of the office and to take Jules\\' blazer to laundry when she stains it, I knew this was a very interesting character in the making. In fact, he does nothing of that sort and the movie, pretty much ends where it begins, with Jules continuing to be the same driven, passionate person who would go to the warehouse and tell her workers how to pack deliveries when clothes were ordered. Very rarely do I want a film to be a good hour or two longer, I could spend a whole season and more with Ben and Jules. Because there is a glaring difference between Jules and her husband, as much as it isn\\'t believable. Lastly, casting, is there anyone that believes a woman like Jules would have a husband like Matt? Neat and proper Jules married to a schmo like him? The storyline is simple: Jules is a rising manager with a company in Brooklyn. Overall headcount of the company = 200 employees = a log of department and a lot of fuss for Jules. The growth of the company makes people believe that they need a director to manage the things and keep Jules on the creative side. The issue is that this might not be what Jules wants nor needs. Hathaway character Jules is the main story - and how bends years of life and business experience is exactly what she needs to tackle her problems. He also becomes a personal beck-and-call person to Jules. Hathawaye Hathaway plays Jules Ostin, a twenty-something CEO of a rising online fashion startup. We see the career-driven side of Jules, but we are basically just told everything we need to know about her in about 5-10 minutes. the scene where they break into Jules\\' mom\\'s house if hilarious and the dialogue is pretty commendable. Ben (Robert De Niro) helps Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway) not only with the company but also with her personal life and shows Jules that she can be a powerful coo of a company without having to lose her position for her husband. Though sometimes, it doesn\\'t hurt seeing a perfect mentor to our ever-so-stressed Jules. bends perfection, maturity and finesse in handling things actually allows the film to focus more on the Jules\\' plotline, adding little to his own character arc, which might imitate some, just barely. He was assigned Intern for Jules. But Jules doesn\\'t liked work with older people. He worked with smile and energy in this workplace and Jules likes his honesty and share her life hard and tough time with him..and finally she accepted him as her Intern.. story is more than my views. Following his looks and the way he dressed, Jules thought Ben can\\'t offer much nether to her, nor to her company. Ben, or Jules\\'s? Ben didn\\'t do much to blend in, while the effort Jules had to do to amend her marriage, sort things out in her company, and bringing her life together was much in comparison to the challenges Ben went through. Inspiring and a good story The movie from the beginning, manages an interesting concept showing the difficulty of older people for employment in a society where everything is modernized and simplified by the internet and computer access, the relationship between the fellow and Jules from the outset was noted tense as she and her direct boss never sent the mail asking for help, but despite this the help without anyone asked and there started a healing and inspiring friendship between two people of different ages, the movie has a good script , each supporting character played an important role, if you want to see a family movie or inspiring this is the one. What we have is a group of nice likeable people being nice and likeable and doing nice and likeable things, but all that happens (SPOILER ALERT, FOR GOD\\'S SAKE DON\\'T READ ON IF YOU HAVEN\\'T SEEN THE PICTURE) is that Quintessential Type A Hathawaye/Jules is overworked and laid-back Robert/Ben helps her deal with this, occasionally dispensing poils of wisdom to the kids from his 70-year vantage point. Jules is married to a stay at home dad (Anders Holm) and has a spunky child, but her work seems to take precedence - until the concept of a senior intern is forced upon her. In the trailer there is a moment where the 4 coworkers talk at a drink and Jules start saying some comparison about the boys from \" now and then \" thing which in the actual movie i did not see. I think, the most fascinating thing about the plot is relationship between Jules and Ben. Ben supports Jules, not only when it\\'s about work, but in her private life. This movie shows the imperfections of human in every corner where Ben kinda perplexed between two women at the beginning and Jules got confused with her purpose of life (running a business) when she found her husband\\'s affair. It is surprising, but he immediately becomes a personal intern of the boss (Jules), that is a young and very powerful woman, even somebody tell him: \"Hang in there. Their relations with the boss are not good, he was deprived of Jules\\' attention, may be because she mistakenly think, that elder cHathawayot help her. Nevertheless, their story begins, when Ben perfectly deals with a problem of Jules\\' drunk driver. Jules is sometimes unhappy, her staff is offering a new coo for her company (to replace her), moreover her husband has an affair. Also, his relationship with Jules is sweet and comforting. Lots of strange mini plots...Jules rides a bike around the office \\'dude\\'. Jules is told to get a ceo. Jules doesn\\'t like her mother. Jules conducts a heist of her mothers house, followed by celebratory shots at the bar where Jules talks of how men are lost in society. Then Jules\\' husband has an affair, whilst her daughter has friendship problems. The story of Jules shows that happiness doesn\\'t come from aligning with others, making sacrifices and hiding things from too observant people. The protagonists, Jules and Ben, are very strong characters and are played beautifully by Hathawaya and Deniro, respectively. Of particular note, is how her own gender slanders Jules with disparaging remarks while conversing with Ben. These selfish women relish in humiliating and belittling Jules in ways that make her question her womanhood. It mainly revolve around Ben and Jules. The \"story\" (or rather a glimpse of some character\\'s lives) followed Ben (Robert De Niro), a 70-year-old widower, hired as an intern for a fashion site run by a frantic and busy woman, Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway), dealing with business problems as well as relationship problems. Throughout the film, Jules is confronted with problems that challenge her role as a mother and a leader of a company, all of which Ben observes and assists in whichever way he can. Everything is just awesome for Jules and everyone supports her regardless of the mistakes she made before (and at no point really stopped making). It shows the struggles that Jules often (Hathaway Hathaway) has with running and being the coo of her own company. Jules is used to portray the modern woman who breaks the social norms of the stay-at-home mother to pursue her dreams. Matt is a depiction of the possible role of the modern day man as a stay-at-home Dad and Jules and mate\\'s relation is the depiction of a modern relationship. Despite not knowing anything about the company, he does small things around the office and helps out the CEO, Jules, to make her day a little simpler. One morning, Ben gets to work extra early to help Jules clean up an extra messy table so she has one less thing to stress about. Besides Ben, Jules, the boss and starter of the company, also defies stereotypes. On the other hand, Jules is a strong, hardheaded woman who believes in overseeing everything and doing everything to make sure it is done. In one clip of the movie featuring the other stay-at-home mothers of the children who go to Jules\\'s daughter\\'s preschool, Ben is talking to the women and the dislike for Jules is obvious, either because they are jealous, or think she does not spend enough time with her child. Once again, Jules goes against most stereotypes that a boss should be a firm, Caucasian man with a stay-at-home wife who does the dishes. Jules often was a stay at home mom before being inspired to create an online shopping website centered around the difficulty behind finding \"The Right Fit\" in clothing. Although the film portrays moms in the workforce, like Jules Ostin, as very hardworking, the film also gives off the vibe that working moms are not able to also be good moms. In one particular scene, subjective point of view through the eyes and ears of Jules was used as she observes the objects in bathroom surrounding her. As Jules and Ben continuously learn and grow with each other throughout this film, so will your desire to keep on watching and unveil the outcome of Jules predicaments. This is where the main character, Jules, runs her up and coming business. After time goes by we meet the other lead role, Jules Ostin. Ben gets one of the intern positions and is assigned to assist Jules with anything she needs. bends relationship with Jules makes for a heartwarming story with some comedy mixed in. The part of Jules has been questioned by some, it is common to feel that her character is putting a poor image on working moms. By the end of the film, Jules fixes this stereotype and establishes a better image for working moms.',\n",
       " 'review_cluster_3': 'Because he\\'s desire he can almost get away with it. Specially that moment when they both work late night and he says he used to work at the same spot years ago. His face was the same 99% of the time he\\'s on screen. \"Mark Zuckerberg never brought in a coo - and he was a teenager!\" Now older, he is doing more dramatic movies and the man still on fire. Some facial expressions are his and no one else could ever do it. He plays more than dignified, hiding a deeper moral than expected and necessary. De Niro was great helping everyone out with everything...but it was a way street....all the young employees were very respectful to him too. Like George Martin said about Billy Preston\\'s time with the Beatles.....he was like a \\'lubricant\\' ...everyone loved him, all the band members were politer to each other and in better spirits...there was no pettyness...John wanted him in the band permanently.....when Preston left he was really missed. Good story to tell; however it never explained why a man with all his experience couldn\\'t take administrative chores off the boss. My favorite scene: in his closet, explaining why all men should carry handkerchiefs. I guess having him sign up for Facebook? Well until he had to cry that is. I get what others are saying about his acting, its tired and old, just like him! SAD he\\'s got to stoop to this crap! Retired from a now defunct company that made phone books, he now spends his days trying to figure out how to spend his days. His wife of 42 years is dead and he needs a challenge. desire plays his character compellingly but a little too straight to convincingly be able to win over the heart of anyone he talks to in just a couple minutes. It was a departure for him and he was precious. De Niro plays a many Poppins/Jeeves type character who never puts a foot wrong.His unbelievable, sage, kindly older man (who can also get an erection) character is fairly 2 dimensional. He carries this movie on his shoulders and does so very well. He\\'s so known for his tough guy roles, that it was refreshing to see this very reserved performance. His is the only decent performance, trying to extract pathos and subtlety where there is none. scout: (Dr. scout Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Well Greg, Robert De Niro doesn t appear to be in any hurry to retire -- both in real life and in this movie. GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) I found the whole thing (re)tiring. GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) But his new boss is Jules: a high-strung workaholic young woman (Hathawaye Hathaway) who micromanages everyone. He not only finds what he is looking for, he also manages to endow several other people s lives with richness, wisdom, and direction. In fact, he much reminds me of a butler similar to poison in 1981 s rather - or even many Poppins. In that review we noted the ultimate destination for the hero is to become a mentor. He has found his final destination. And so he is developmentally ready to just assume a helping role, a mentoring function. However, he fully adapts to work in the job due to his rich lifestyle and unique sociability. He has used to analog, but his mind is still hot. Although he may seem trivial, it is in fact crucial in terms of today\\'s concern over different from the average 70 years old people we imagine. This is one of his best performances in years. He\\'s professional and chivalrous, sure, but he\\'s also a self-described \"pile of mush\" and a self-proclaimed feminist. A film about a retired man who goes back into working to escape the boring environment he was in. He doesn\\'t do bad performances, but that hasn\\'t stopped him in the past from taking on roles and movies that are well below his standards. device played true to his sophomoric character that he\\'s most known for playing, whIle Holm took on a more serious and in depth role. Fitting right in as he had a very long career in business, they form an offbeat friendship that nobody would have expected. That may also be the script\\'s fault for creating a flat gentleman hero of yore to act as julep\\'s foil and to be put on a pedestal as the classic man all men should strive to be. Now in his 70\\'s, he\\'s retired and widowed, and in the position of having too much time on his hands. His life is stagnant and he doesn\\'t really know what to do with himself anymore. Personally it was nice to see desire in his old age, acting as a sweet and lovable guy. It shows a real range in acting from his youth. If there\\'s Robert De Niro, we\\'re always fine. He even uses his trademark scowl with a very different result. A man finds his true passion after his retirement from a phonebook printing company despite his passed-away wife included. Although this isn\\'t a true story, I loved his \"get up and go\" attitude and the fact that he was willing to do anything to keep busy. He tells his coworkers to be polite and treat women with respect and then watches one of them use an emotional moment for leverage in wooing a female co-worker. His business background was in another industry not a different planet. Who says chivalry is dead? De Niro has found his second wind as a comedic presence, still hard to see \"Tommy\" from Goodfellas without thinking he\\'s going to kick somebody in the teeth. i nitro never ceases to amaze me with his wonderful ability to switch from Drama to comedy. Since the man is cheating, he is acting on an impulse. Bobby D is of ultimate class. In a span of 48 hours, I saw him in Dirty Grandpa and this, and you couldn\\'t come up with two diametrically-opposed characters if you tried. For once, he\\'s not playing a brass gangster (Godfather Part i or Goodfellas) or a raunchy asshole (the aforementioned Dirty Grandpa). Sure, De Niro\\'s golden age is behind him, but the depth and nuance he brings to kindly old gent Ben (played with subtlety, as this is obviously a less showy role than the Bickles and LaMottas) show that he still very much has the chops - he makes the role his own to the point that it\\'s impossible to imagine another actor playing it. He gave advices to lie and people all around him, in other words, he was a wise man and very experienced in everything that people would encounter in their long life journey. Robert de Niro plays a very sweet grandpa-ish character. His character is much different than the one we\\'re used to. It was fun to see de hero in this unique roll for him. An academy award nomination for Mr. De Niro. He is THAT good here. I want to have the same energy he got at his age. Never disappointed by his movies. (Not to mention the ever suave Rene Russo). Also, desire acted as though he were part of an earlier time period (more wait than Baby boomer). Not a diner fan and he surely sucked here. way you might expect, and downplays his thin technology skills. Meyers\\' work is polished in every regard. Give De Niro a consistent role he can still play. When dais had problem to find a place he didn\\'t offer his home right away, he did let him find things by himself but when he had no other option other than leaving the place, he offered help to share his home. He didn\\'t advise even a bit anywhere about the situation. Being older and having lost his wife he was able to be a mentor to all the younger male inters as well as others in the office. He may be retired but he still has a life and a purpose. People NEED him. He wasn\\'t the first to make such an asinine statement. We have seen him play mobsters, lunatics, a comedian, protective father, and many more. He is accepted. desire is his usual charming best Take a look at this movie, it\\'s not pretentious at all and he\\'s having a good time doing it. Right, Carlos? Someone should tap him on the shoulder and stop him from getting involved in junk like this . I am a huge fan of his, even if some of the recent movies he has starred in haven\\'t been so good, I still think he is a great actor. Loved the life lessons desirous character teaches everyone about chivalry & being a classy man. He does whatever it takes to make everyone\\'s day better around him. His character just seemed so complacent. Mr. De Niro, I have never seen him so precious in a film. However, Holm feels a bit miscast as the husband. He suits the role early as the stay at home dad playing with the daughter, however, in the final act of the movie, he doesn\\'t bring enough depth to the character to hold the weight the scenes required. Clever and well acted without requiring a willing suspension of disbelief Thought the De Niro character would come through much stronger, but turns out he was just another weak male in a cast of male non-performers. He had me from the first scene, and what a pleasure it was to watch him with renew runs as they steal the show. Love Robert of Niro. Nice to see him in this type of role! When you look at Robert De Niro, you picture him as a tough, smart \"Mafia-like\" type of character. This movie showed him as the opposite. Especially the roll of the lead singers husband! Husband was very miscast. it\\'d say it\\'s probably his best since Meet the Parents and his most lovable character ever. I asked him he hat he thought and he liked it as well. Robert de Niro is an actor who seems to have decided to change his artistic direction in the last 15 years, and this film will be remembered as the least embarrassing for the actor. Robert de Niro est excellent dans un contre-emploi qui rend parfaitement hommage à son talent, tandis qu\\'Hathawaye Hathaway est moins insupportable qu\\'à l\\'accoutumée. desire is the opposite of a manic pixie dream girl, he is a Calm Progressive Dream Grandpa, the intangible but eminently crush-able strong, supportive man that checks all the boxes. He might as well walk around with a sign that says ism a douche bag. Surprisingly entertaining, and the best thing is that Robert De Niro again acts, read, is not automatically with the last 15 years (except two or three exceptions). Cause I haven\\'t seen him not being grumpy, unfriendly and mean on screen for quite a long time. And I keep thinking that his role would go to Robin willies if he is still alive. His charisma and gentle mHathawayers takes us back to a slower, more enjoyable life and pace that can still work in today\\'s nonstop world. He\\'s too perfect and he brings no conflict to the table; in fact, he\\'s boring. Sure, his homespun logic and chill advice are clever, and it is too obvious. HE\\'S DELIGHTFUL!!! BOBBY HAS NEVER BEEN SO... CHARMING. Its lead (Mr. Robert De Niro) has never been more likable. You wouldn\\'t even know it\\'s the same guy who played psychotics (Taxi Driver, Cape Fear), hardened criminals (Heat, The Family), and ornery grandpappys (Meet the Fockers, Little Fockers) some years ago. He\\'s retired, he\\'s traveled the world, he hangs out at Starbucks, and when walking down the street, he gets hit on by weird women (Linda lain from the to show Alice, who\\'d thunk it). Sadly, this is not enough for him. He\\'s retired with money yet is bored. That\\'s why he takes on the task of working in commerce territory. With endeavors like Grudge Match, Last Vegas, New Year\\'s Eve, and 2013\\'s Killing Season, he hasn\\'t been too picky about his projects. I can\\'t believe I eve used that word to describe him, but he is cute and charming. In true Hollywood fashion this 70 year old middle-class guy just happens to have spent his career as VP of publishing company (don\\'t all middle class people retire from upper level management?). To begin with his a joke, but as the film goes on he turns into the hero! A mildly interesting premise - what would happen if 70 year old Robert De Niro were working for internet startup entrepreneur Hathawaye Hathaway? 61 year old Rene Russo is the love interest for De Niro, The rest of the characaters are not really explored serving variously as foils for De Niro or Hathaway. ism not typically a desire fan but he was awesome. I want him to come work with me. all that nonsense bullshit of how inspired you are about Myers. He was not a good at new technology.But he had wisdom, humbleness and experience. He loves chines tax chi. It makes him healthy. I hope he lives till age of 100 years oldest the end of the movie, lie joined his tax Chi lesson hope that she enjoy her men moment! In the 1950s-60s, the nose-to-the-grindstone man in the gray flHathawayel suit was seen as a person whose family was ignored at the expense of attention to his family. At 70 he is retired and bored, but he doesn\\'t come across either as a fuddy-duddy Luddite or a swinging grandpa. he\\'s old, right? After traveling the globe for awhile, he is back home and hates thinking about living at home all days he keeps himself busy all the time, sometimes he goes to visit his kids, or goes to sawbucks etc. He has made many comedies throughout his career but for the past decade and a half it seems he wants to be Jerry Lewis! I really wished he would have responded \"You Talking To Me?\" He traveled the world and engaged in a wide variety of physical and intellectual pursuits to keep himself occupied, but it wasn\\'t enough. No matter what their strengths and achievements, your protagonists are inevitably emotional, irrational, and in need of a man to make things right. Dad was the weakest character though. Still he meets a girl oriented girl, Hatheway. He always cares about the personally. Rob is the very charming and engaging kind of dude which I would love to become later on down the road. bends chivalrous and experienced attitude makes him the epitome of the title \"oldie but goodie\". Though his work is frequently such a perfect fit for the scene that it is unnoticed, Theodore shaping delivers a whimsical and delightful soundtrack for whatever the tone of the scene requires. After his most recent work, Shapiro is quickly becoming a respectably accomplished composer for comedy (he is possibly becoming the new Christophe Beck). desire makes his usual amount of facial expressions. Very good inside look at a older retired coo who decides not to sit on the sidelines in his prime. desire is giving it his all and though some of the dialogue is not good, he does a decent job delivering them. Everyone wants him and he\\'s there to teach wise lessons. Love him! He also teaches the youngsters about values and other things from his past. The only weak performance with a very flimsily developed and bland character comes from wanders Holm. He had worked out, traveled the world, read books, on and on. While he is relatively happy, he feels empty. He is seventy years old when he reads a flyer on a bulletin board. Eventually, by taking on some of the hard work and showing utter kindness, he manages to become quite the institution in the firm. His son\\'s family lives out of town. He tries to fill his days of leisure. His life starts the film, he is the one that leads the audience to the situation, but he has no flaws. He has the dilemma. He has absolutely no character arc. He is a widower with too much free time and sort of has a void to be filled, I guess? He doesn\\'t seem to be suffering, and all of his problems are solved at the first 5 minutes. What is his change after that? He is a perfect gentleman who does not learn anything in particular, does not grow, has no epiphany or real change. He is a mentor figure, he is not a protagonist. He just does tax Chi and that\\'s it. He keeps it consistent, keeps it believable, hits the tone and sells of that character. I mean, imagine Bill hurray in that same role. desire can do it because he is one of the best, he knows how to pull it off, and he does. He\\'s a mild mHathawayered good guy who wants to not be bored. Rene Russo. Where did HE go? Yet now that he is widower, he still feels empty. It may be no Taxi Driver or Cape Fear, but he still seems to be saying a lot with how to relaxed the millennial generation has become. Robert De Niro, as a retired 70 year old who re-enters the work force and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that oldies are still goodies_x0085_.also proves just why he is a star as he shines so bright in this movie as to be blinding. He is perfection. Instead, we are just to believe that his Gandhi-like influence on co-workers is the only reward he seeks. 2 his for a 45 in story! What a thoughtful, charming, helpful old man he is. How a guy who played such ruthless characters in \"Goodfellas\" and \"Taxi Driver\" can pull off this avuncular gentlemen is a testament to his craft. His Ben whittler almost seems too perfect, but desire brings a humanity that makes him eminently believable. He\\'s also there for the beautiful icehouse masseuse, Fiona, who has taken a shine to him, and vice versa. They see a man who wears a suit and carries a handkerchief but has amazing wisdom and business smarts. Who doesn\\'t love Bobby Deniro? He vanishes after his 2.5 seconds on the screen, never to be seen again. Bobby_x0085_ who has never done a bad thing in his life. Oh, and when Bobby drops by to give \"Matt\" (Anders Holm) a piece of his righteous mind, Matt has to tell him to \"watch out for all the legs pieces\" everywhere. Since the man has NOTHING TO DO except DEDICATE himself to \"Paige\" and \"Jules\" — why wouldn\\'t he have the time to pick up the Lego pieces? Wouldn\\'t he himself trip over them? Even Bobby knew that he was supposed to keep one foot on the floor. Oh and along the way, he hooks up with a glamorous grHathawayy also on the company payroll, employed, I kid you not, as a permanent masseuse. I\\'m all for reducing age-discrimination in the workplace but really De Niro\\'s character only lacks a pair of wings to make him today\\'s equivalent of Clarence from \"It\\'s A Wonderful Life\". He is contrite by the end. He plays this insane knife salesman who meets this young black baseball player who\\'s a superstar but is having personal problems. like say, when he finds out his adorable boss\\' no good husband is cheating. He really should have gone all insane knife salesman on the guy. Or like in CAPE FEAR, he could have started bombarding the wayward husband with Bible verses and mumbling cryptic warnings like, \"you\\'re gonna learn about loss.\" He says, \"I still have music in me.\" He is not enjoying his retirement. Like every newbie at work, although he is not, he longs to get some tasks and help his mentor in every way possible. The whole movie revolves around bends life and how he cheers up everybody around him all the time with his cuteness and wisdom. And De Niro, make no mistakes, is one of the greatest, no matter how many mediocre roles he has down to his name. This one is one of his best roles in recent years, and he does it with his usual professional attitude and with his usual intelligence. Because of his background, he\\'s kept up with technology and appears to be an old fashioned gentleman in an environment where dress codes are very relaxed and social etiquette is a thing of the past. Somewhere in the movie De Niro talks to himself in the mirror... I couldn\\'t but see his younger version in Taxi Driver and for 1 second I was hoping that he WOULD say his famous line, then we would all have been reassured that it was all just a big parody, but he didn\\'t (of course) and everything went downhill further along. The 72- year-old actor might as well had his screen debut here. He was smart (waaay smart) with his money for his retirement, he didn\\'t let anything get him down, he was always curious to learn more, set in his ways without judgment of anyone else and most importantly, he always put others first. He was human and perfect at the same time. Many of his characteristics, mHathawayerisms, old school methods and official politeness that my father shares blended into my life as well. At first he informs us being on his own for the first time in years was exciting, as he was able to travel around the world and experience new things. But once home, despite attempting to keep busy, he still feels alone. Participating in seemingly uplifting activities such as weekly tax chi classes provides little solace as it does nothing to provide the companionship and a purpose in life which he so craves. Now he pursues his tax chi class with vigor, having achieved the spiritual integration he was seeking. He has a complete lack of anymore of antipathy or disillusionment for finding himself in that situation - being bossed around the office and managed by people who have been on this planet for a quarter of the time he has, and who are genuinely childish, stupid and unprofesional. He makes friends in the flesh as well as on Facebook. However new he may be to new tech, his old savvy in business, style and human relations proves a boon to the others. One young guy buys a classic briefcase on eBay. He actually weeps a bit, sentimental mush that he admits to being. The established old geezer occupies the same role in the casting as his character does in the plot — he\\'s the man of experience and wisdom who provides a model for the young bloods. He may not be teach savvy like people of today like the Generation Z and Millennial groups. But he does offer wisdom and comfort and proves you need to give people his age a chance. One day, while going about his mundane everyday routine, he comes across a flyer. wanders Holm is great as Matt. mojo usher is adorable as Paige. back spearman is hilarious as Davis. mason orle is impressive as Lewis. wanders Holm as stinks cheating husband gives a hideous plead for forgiveness that is laughable and unconvincing. Furthermore, his relationship with find got off a little strange but cute as well. Will he become the coo being sought? He would\\'ve kept his job and they could have lived quite comfortably with child care arrangements. bends discomfort and conflicts between his true feelings and reality checks are beautiful. De Niro through his character shows to all of us, fast-paced, time- deprived and life-deprived generation X or Y or whatever, that there\\'s always room for calmness and for living. Just noticed A.... A...Ron, actor Zack Pearlman, had to rack my brains where I remember him from.. Key&Peele. He was always dressed at costume and his suitcase, old school stuff. Maybe that\\'s because Holm is such a lousy actor. So, of course, he has to dress like a slob and have a ratty beard. desire gives a very controlled performance (is he bored, too?) and one wonders if, 40 years ago when he was heralded as america greatest living actor, he would have even considered doing tripe like this. He\\'s often come across as a bit samey in recent years, like he\\'s just playing the same guy over and over again, almost wooden. He shows great skill in delivering his lines with just the right air of worldly-wise experience and charm. He brings that warm smile that brings confidence and wisdom, no matter the situation. Does he need the money? His talents and old-fashioned state of mind kept him employed for many years, and though he has found retirement relaxing and mentally freeing, he is still antsy in his every day life. He wants to do something big, but can\\'t figure out what that something should be. His refreshing honesty and common sense approaches to conflicts are something a generation raised on the impersonal communication devices of email and Twitter find so preposterous that they\\'re brilliant. He recently retired from a successful career, but seems to know next to nothing about computers. His friends are dropping like flies, but he is in excellent health. The character played by desire seems a bit too flawless to be overall believable, but he\\'s charming enough to get away with it. And he did not, that is, not as a lover or wife. He could have accidentally produced a new fashion, or killed off an existing one. He could have stumbled into a genius success at being a coo while not bumping off the protagonist. Imagine if he accidentally made the right ones. Can\\'t he just retire with some dignity? Does he have to made a fool of himself with all the trash he appears in lately? Does he need money that badly? We should all have a charity fund for him rather than watch him become a grade \"B\" (no make that a grade \"F\") actor. Of course, it\\'s never fully explained what his responsibilities shall be, but he does become the darling of the office and shows his business experience to internet clothing business lady Hathaway Hathaway. He imparts wisdom and friendship. He never gets angry once, and he only makes life better for the employees at the company. He\\'s such a charismatic and likable character. Cameron, has an identity crisis. Who is he? I had some possible assumptions during the movie, I thought, is he the villain? Is he trying to plot with the coos to take over the company? This character is controvertial. He\\'s super competent, humble, kind, caring, and hard-working. His eyes twinkle and his cheeks are pinchable. He would make the perfect father, boss, or Santa. He is a kindly mentor to younger male employees who rarely shave and don\\'t tuck in their shirts. He does all the right things, he says all the right things, he wears a suit every day and smiles all the time. Throughout the movie, bends experience serves him well, a problem is solved, and life moves forward. Oh, he does about 1.1/2 hours in and it\\'s kind of glossed over. Even vacations aren\\'t a solution, because the final destination, home, always reminds him of his wife. He realizes he has to stay active, do something...anything. As a retired widower, he misses his wife and desires to be reconnected to his previous life in the working world. Those connections with people and that feeling of accomplishment and purpose that drove him to get out of bed each day. realizing he is there to help this young entrepreneur to find her place in the unforgiving world of business. He delivers the business savvy and vulnerability that make this role convincing and entertaining. maybe bobby\\'s age is to blame ? While he won\\'t do any action movie from now on (probably, never say never), which would be a wise decision, he can and does do comedies anchor dramas (the latter especially good with jennies clarence as leading lady). He has a routine, he likes to be out and about, but he still feels somewhat useless. He had a long career and a high position, but manufacturing phone books became a historical footnote. So he makes his video resume\\', uploads it, emails it, and gets an interview. But he wants to be back interacting with people and to be needed. Consequently, he he is loved by his co-workers. But he is also indispensable for the knowledge he has gleaner over seventy years. His character reminds one of the Character Murphy played in Holy Man, he\\'s always pleasant, never has a bad word to say about anyone, and is always at hand to help. Show me a single person who doesn\\'t love him. Once again he did it. ism not going to praise him or say that he was good. But that\\'s just me, I love him in anything. So he signs up for the special program. He comes into the company and immediately impresses everybody he is in contact with. He\\'s a guy who always wears suits and tie, who practices gallantry and whose presence reassures and oozes respect. But in fact, the reason he put so much love in his work is because love and work are the two main drivers of life. As you expect, his presence makes things better for the office and, most importantly, for the young, dynamic, and successful Ostin, who had initially hated him. I was Seeing that Guy Taking a little ride in the trunk of a Lincoln Continental. He\\'s became very lonely, and bored, in recent times. He discovers a new world for him but he is excited about it since he wanted a new challenge in his life because retirement was boring for him. He\\'s what guys should aspire to be when they\\'re 70. He\\'s classy, he\\'s sharp, he\\'s charming and optimistic. De Niro... \\'The perfect man\\'... He is a legend and he shows it with this movie too. Simple, pure and talented. While he may never have another role like he did in \\'Casino\\' or \\'Goodfellas\\' or \\'Taxi Driver\\' he can still act absolutely exquisitely. He decides to challenge it. Then, his new life starts. At first, he doesn\\'t have any knowledge, but he does hard what he can do. This is probably his most solid performance since \\'Silver Linings Playbook\\', cool cameo in \\'American Hustle\\' aside. cloche Yet Surprisingly Decent Being a Living Legend has its pros and cons. Despite immersing himself in various activities (fitness, travel, languages, etc.) Young coworkers who learn a lot from him. But he wins people over and makes fast friends over his old school approach. The building where he works there is a twist you have to see. What Ben Whittacker brings to the table is confidence tempered with humility and restraint. He is old school in mHathawayers and dress, however he becomes a calming presence on the technology savvy and live-for-the-moment genie\\'s that surround him. He claims to be happy, he just needs to fill that time with something productive. A man known for playing foul mouthed tough guys, plays a heartwarming old man trying to be relevant again. He had a job printing phone books for a living, talk about feeling outdated. Now he has to learn how to use a us drive, something his nine year old nephew helps him with. He can do it. He is on screen for almost every scene and holds our attention throughout. I don\\'t think he expected to experience everything that he did by taking that position. SPOILER ALERT: He did it just to ease his boredom but he got the opportunity to nurture and mentor his seemingly cold boss as well as find love again. Rather than sending in the conventional resumé, he is asked to upload a video of himself arguing his competencies. This is his appearance throughout the film. His fatherly role is an admirable quality, but at the end of the day, he is too tired to have sex with his bread- winning wife. Now we know why Matt was too tired for sex. He\\'s a masculine man, and he argues that one should dress to impress. His comment about Matt being a just Century husband was comical, but also very true. A character walks in on this act, and we are shown the scene from his point of view, which looks as if the masseuse is... The husband is feeling so far left out of the marriage he is having an affair. His understanding, though, goes a long way to help the overall situation. Robert De Niro is ... (well, what can you say? If not the best, one of the best acts of his life. Hard to believe that the actor who played the semi-psychotic traves Bickle in \\'Taxi Driver\\' is the same one who plays a wizened intern here. desire shows his talents in what he doesn\\'t do, he plays a \\'less is more\\' type of nuance to his character and it works. It is so fantastic to see Robert De Niro actually commit to a performance 110% and his commitment truly delivers. He\\'s got everything organized and set, except he\\'s run out of things to spend his time on. He\\'s your prototypical nice guy. It gets hilarious to see some of his interactions with his colleagues, and how he starts having everyone\\'s back because he so has his stuff together. Can he find fulfillment? Can he find new love? His acting was not strong enough, nor believable enough. He helps save the business, gives everyone advice on relationships, hooks up with the firms hot, but mature, icehouse masseuse, whilst introducing all the nerdy geek guys around him to the benefits of carrying a handkerchief. There is even a small homage to \\'Taxi Driver\\' as he repeatedly practices eye-blinking in front of a mirror \"You looking at me\" style. However, what is the man who manifested Travis Bickle, gave us a young Vito Corleone and chHathawayeled Jimmy Conway, doing in this formulaic fluff of a movie. Either way we can only hope for a return to more gritty roles, although his next release entitled \\'Dirty Grandpa\\' suggests otherwise. 70 years old man helps his boss many times, but he doesn\\'t show off his talent. Although it is different from real world, its position like him gives hope for young worker. He plays the gentleman we should see much more often in life. he had a dark past? he has some naughty vices? He is just perfect! He is very believable as an ex top-executive that is very modest and helpful no matter the chore. You feel he has much more to offer to anyone willing to ask for business advices. De hero\\'s character could have been a patronizing know-it-all after 40 years in business but he wasn\\'t. You figure Bobby has rarely let you down so; what the hey? Bobby, consummate pro, although his face always seems to be frozen in that \"You talking to me?\" A heartwarming-style comedy drama A man finds his true passion after his retirement from a phonebook printing company despite his passed-away wife included. madam device as mason was good in his comic portions. wanders Holm had a sincerity in his role. Better still, don\\'t go to the interviews, no one wins De Nero. desire delivers as usual as I truly believed him in the role and rooted for him throughout. He decides to reenter the workforce, but what just century company would take a chance on a \"geezer\" like him? He\\'s already led a full life and has his priorities straight. With his business accouterments, natty suit and tie (and ever-present handkerchief), and his quiet, rational confidence, he was a class act. whittler was doubted at first, but his charm, intelligence, experience and wisdom quickly gained him the likes and trust of his coworkers. A few surprisingly strong moments were those \"small-talks\" - an instance would be when De Niro during a post-work conversation with his employer Hathaway, tells her that their current work spaces were refurbished on the then defunct phone book factory where he worked for 40 odd years - and the very moment when Hathaway\\'s eyes light up, one tends to feel the same apparent effervescence. His character is a spoon unassuming guru with understated rather than preachy wisdom. He is willing to adapt with the youth environment, erasing the stigmas on elderly hating the youth. I wonder how many thousands of takes it took to just get him through the flotsam of slop of cuts he left in his wake? Anders Holm. While I like him in meatier scripts, he showed his versatility and makes acting look like a profession and art, not just an exercise in repeating memorized lines. He does it not for any financial reason but because he is \"bored.\" He is very laid back and calm, while (younger) people around him are nervous, suffer, and don\\'t know what to do. He is just oozing with charm and class here and still has great comedic timing here. Matt-not deep enough but real. I mean, he had no faults. But I liked him so . He wasn\\'t all that charming even with his kid when they were at play. He had no irony, wit, humor or charm. He\\'s been there, done that and just needs something to do. His devotion to help his boss is something I can relate to, and the hip and modern environment they work in I recognize as well. I prefer his more serious movies. Even someone as intelligent as him would still have struggled more than was shown. He mesmerizes you throughout the movie. You feel for his character and the position he\\'s in. His advice that comes from his experience is so valuable for June and coworker.The feature of his advice is not only as working but also private.He attends to coworker as a person who has family and his attitude for the coworkers attracts them.All the man who see the film can learn the importance of carring the handkerchief. A man who easily charms others by the way he talks with all that experience and maturity he has in him is a delight to watch. He efficiently handles all the situations and is apt in his own old way. I don\\'t know how he was received with this one. He plays an old gentleman who is so sweet that at some point, while watching the movie, you wish to be like him when you get old. Unlike other seniors who showed up for the job he is the most full of life and physically fit. He impress every body and he is Mr. Congeniality of the company. There is no one that can top that man. I love the work that he does. He can be funny, he can be serious, he is fabulous! I don\\'t know if he is teaching them as they are doing their roles during the filming or if he just has that magic touch that brings it out when you see the film in its finished process. Though he conquers-not technically, but by being everyone\\'s friends-employing that seasoned old man\\'s knowledge. His character is mature to a fault. In scenes where you expect him to unknowingly make a mess of things, he doesn\\'t. I can\\'t stand schmaltz. His honest and sincere behavior changes the company gradually. Is there anything this man can\\'t do? And never do you feel sorry for him, he doesn\\'t act like a victim, there\\'s no putty party, he takes it as it comes and does the best out of every situation. Keep an eye on him. He never over plays it. He looks so genuine and still smart at this age wearing the suits for work which has a start up culture (This makes me realize that Suits always enhance your personality and add a class to your personality). He didn\\'t sell it at all, I never found him charming or warm, or had any sort of relationship with her. We as viewers don\\'t know this man, all we know he isn\\'t good looking, he cheats, lies, go out of his way to have an affair. We don\\'t know this man, what makes him special? I imagine Robert De Niro\\'s character was intentionally designed to stick as close to the wise old man/sweet father-figure stereotype as possible, and in De Niro\\'s case with a perma-smile, and it works in this film most of the time. There is no character arc whatsoever for him in this film. De Niro\\'s character finishes the movie with a girlfriend (Russo), a new close friend/boss (Hathaway), but how is he a different man than when he started? How is he changed? What has he gone through? A cheating husband, of course. Really, have you ever seen such a man over 65 around you? An incredibly calm, good, modern, kind, good looking, healthy old man who knows everything makes an online shopping company better? wanders Holm, however, was a let down - such an important role to get right, but what we got was a husband with no personality and dead eyes. I also enjoyed his etiquette which he shared with the young men who were his co-workers. He knows every nook of the place and now he has come back to it. The way he chooses his wardrobe each evening and prepares it for the next day... people don\\'t do that anymore! where are the men like care Grant or garrison Ford? We learn that he has more to offer then what he looks like and that the office he worked at was his old workplace. There, he supports his 28-year old female boss tackle professional, social, and personal problems that come with cracking the glass-ceiling, becomes a personal driver to the boss, and acts as an agony- uncle to young co-workers. At the end of the film, he takes a day off to get back to a yoga session with his retired mates who are previously shown very early in the film when he is plHathawaying to do something more interesting! Coming into a just Century teach industry with a with Century attitude he becomes a part of the company. Because he is a class act, people begin to trust him and love him. He teaches them another perspective about life. His personality seems to be undecided and incomplete, so he appears awkward. You can\\'t be sure if he is exuberant and gay (unsure), or if he is just exuberant. He gets his moments to show depth as well. He is eager to learn and has adjusted comfortably to the 21st century, except he dresses in an old-fashioned mHathawayer, which his colleagues initially make light of. mojo usher is simply adorable. He also manages to help almost everyone he meets! He is generally a very lovable character. He is just made for it. Did I really write \\'Robert De Nero\\'? De Niro is just fucking adorable! He wants to work in a new world environment. There is unarguably no one in this whole world who could have done better justice to this role as he has. He is an epitome of being a gentleman- one who says the right things at the right times - and through him the film shows what experience brings to the table. Even the trifle things he does affects you like for example being compelled to tuck in your shirts all the time or carry around a crisply folded hanky, so on and so forth .His expressions are so self explanatory and transparent and it truly demonstrates what a fine artist he is. He didn\\'t fail, not even once in any of his tasks. Especially, when he mentioned at the beginning of the movie that he used to call his grandson to ask him what the heck is a USB, but we see him smoothly using a laptop, doing emails, and he even changed from an old sassing to an phone with no much of a struggle. Helpful, thoughtful, leading man. Plus, his thinking of his wife got me tears in some scenes because I felt really sorry for him. He was cute old man. He has a family (son and grandchildren), which live quite far from him, and he\\'s a widower. He has plenty of time and desire to do something new. In his 70s, he\\'s still smiling every day, open for new activities, making connections with people, staying polite and conservative. He\\'s sure that this exactly what he needs: creative atmosphere, challenging tasks, ability to help others. But he\\'s facing with prejudice from the side of colleagues. He understands such the common beliefs and just tries to help the firm doing his best. It is very nice of him to offer a possibility of being buried together, as there is a lot of place near his wife\\'s grave. Completely different role for De Niro. Lately, his movies kind of lack of himself, and he lost the stigma he had about cinema back when he shot Meet the Fockers. He radicalizes these roles, and contrasts them so well, despite the quality of thee. Not even capo could! He gave it just the right touch. He says \"sounds like she is bipolar\" with a little smirk on his face. Later in the movie he and his daughter are at the playground. He and his daughter look at each other and smile, \"Yep, bipolar\". And his performance was, of course, impeccable as ever. He does not have an email, he does not know how to navigate Facebook, much less does he know how to online shop. However, he is still successful in the company because of his proper ways. He teaches the rest of his coworkers the proper mHathawayerisms needed to excel at life and please your boss. He wastes no time and applies for the job.',\n",

We all know what it is to spread ourselves too thin and feel like an outsider. Learn something about work-life balance and how to fit in by being yourself. But I guess that\\'s life...messy. The only pro I give is the feminism behind showing that women can be on top but it is done in the most disgraceful way. Extremely capitalist and pro destroying everything around you for your job. to with going to bars with employees (which you don\\'t know their name because you are too \"powerful\") instead of going home and spend time with your family. The idea of feminism is to become better collectively and not for women to start acting like the stereotypical men. Also, sexual harrassment is out there like a joke...really? Is it of because it is done to a guy? It somehow teaches way of living. The messages about social and gender roles seem overly simplified and sort of muddy at the same time. Has a low-key feel to it. So there is something to it... although i don\\'t think it ever really hit the mark it was aiming for. Less about what is said . more about how it is said. Rather, more something about how people can feel. Interactions. We all know about what it takes to put a winning production together. about people. Pick your own person to identify with. Taught me the value of keeping my mouth shut more often. wanders really didn\\'t make me connect with or feel for the husband at all. Or am I just narrow minded. Do work because it makes me think of myself with pride and self-esteem, rather to obsess over money! It puts life, feminism, work, marriage, kids on the table and discusses it. Life lessons are demonstrated naturally and not in a boring way. It\\'s almost as they are connected with each other and with you and me. It also make them feel that they belong or they are still part of something....a community. Everything just fell into place. Even if we are, I would not mind it. Then it punches you in the gut and you never recover. Along the way, both are able to find friendship and reliable people they can count on. Like a breath of fresh air...no violence, swearing, politics.....just considerate people. It is such a positive message that drives home what being a good person and a hard worker means. Neither of them has problems other than being workaholics. And when a problem arises, everything will be resolved sooner rather than later. The two build a nice friendship that, it\\'s a relief to report, doesn\\'t bloom into a May-December. The problem is, that\\'s about it. The people around the office are young whippersnappers whose function in the film is to be young whippersnappers and they don\\'t matter either. then it happens. It has moments here and there when it shows the promise of what it might have been. Virtually shoving its modernity down our throats. No lags, no genuine emotion. However there is a lot to like about it. Almost like they are not scripted. Very biased and an obvious propaganda piece. Cool concept. And before you know it they re best buddies. Regardless, their relationship evolves and becomes transformation for them both. There s no nuance here. I found it all very patronizing verging on condescending. There s nothing condescending about needing help and giving help; it s just a reality of lifespan development. There s no real villainy to speak of. I we already outlined my thoughts on them. Even though it is unrealistic to express the company. My discussion of the events is in fact addressing the larger matter of limitations of situations. Although I hate to admit it, \\'\\'I\\'m just a big bowl of mush\\'\\' too. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.\\' Here, the meter\\'s work hits and elbow point, and slowly becomes more about proving a point than telling a compelling story. We can\\'t help but think that meters did to the intern what a freshman college student does to his midterm paper. It starts promising, but the spectator quickly ends up feeling like a literature professor reading a paper pushed trough with unhealthy amounts of caffeine. Makes you feel happy and not as scared of the future as you were before. They can be a nice change of pace every now and again. Until they become friends, there were a lot of things about job, love, and friend. Originality basically stops there. But these were people you could see yourself sitting down to have a meal with and know that you would enjoy it. The characters accept this as simply as you would wearing socks with shoes. In-authenticity is never a good thing. So, to me it is fake and depressing. However, this one strays from the expectations of its kind. When there\\'s something interesting is going on, we forget to focus on the flaws and enjoy our time, which is what I exactly did in here. I mean, the story is about the digital business and most of them who are into the computers are considered as geeks. So theirs world is nothing, but just hooked to their works and forgetting the actual world around them. Even for the someone in the next room, they tweet. There\\'s something to be said for that. But ism pretty sure Mark Twain said it first. What is the core morale behind this? What do they want to express? How is that even possible? It\\'s not quite a rom-com. The dialog feels like a disjointed mog-pog of greeting card oneliners. A little dull or off track in parts, but still stays in one piece. Our life lessons can help others if everyone is willing. Money is not happiness. It\\'s friendship, and being able to trust people. Money doesn\\'t buy from people. Keeping up with corporate success can take its toll on the best of personal relations in the best of times. Interesting premise. Don\\'t know why it cost $35,000 to make. This is something that happens in today\\'s world. Good morals are developed throughout and it is all put together rather nicely. But de hire it. While at points being a bit thin on substance. While doing it with charm, class and style at every turn of the way. It has the potential to challenge the incessant questions kick-butt actresses and female coos are asked about balancing home and work, but it doesn\\'t. And the writing is rather clever in its commentary on the modern workplace. Well, if it\\'s the only thing on, it\\'s okay. The rom-com tone is a bit out of place at times. The connection between the two is supposed to be one of friendship and understanding. But on screen it seems like nothing built up to that moment. One minute they are strangers, in the next moment best friends, missing any real emotional built up. I know people who react stronger when the girl at sawbucks get\\'s their order wrong! Fun and emotional sorry if how one mans life can influence someone else\\'s. Once the great men are all gone will we only be left with \"micro-agressions\", \"safe spaces\", and skinny jeans? My hope is that we tire of fad-driven snobbishness and handkerchief sales go through the roof. You\\'re never wrong to the Right thing. While it says some right things about the commerce startup industry, it is too muddled and superficial in depicting it on screen. Many dimensions and a unlikely friendship. Very sad to we desire go out like this. Does this rely too much on stereotypes without poking enough fun at them? Will there relationship start off rocky, but steadily improve? Will they learn a life lesson or two from each other along the way? Pulls at your heart strings just enough. Audiences want \"hope\", the private areas of life or the base behavior does not give hope to anyone. Typical feel good drama. There\\'s fashion, sexual politics, and the beauty of brooklet brownstones but not a lot else. Throws every emotional turd at the wall to see what sticks. It reminds you that regardless of how overwhelming life may sometimes be, it\\'s important to take a step back and appreciate both the people and things around you. and I personally should respect it. So all in all a job well done by all the people involved. Moral views were ð?? affirms masculinity and true femininity. But both those who like it and those who don\\'t are correct. EXCRUCIATINGLY SEXIST! About hardships, trust, friendship and happiness. That\\'s the only good and bad thing about it. A few adult situations, but little to no swearing and no nudity. It\\'s kind of the case with a lot of successful male Entrepreneurs since Entrepreneurship became a thing. With that said, ism not sure how I would have done it differently either, so I have respect for the guts taken to end it there, when there was really nowhere else for it to go. Smartphones vs flip phones. Writing vs typing. Phone books vs contacts list. Deserving of a much more higher rating than these weird professional critics are giving it. It doesn\\'t really have an answer and the balance is not good. It really speaks to women who want to have it all and how other people can\\'t seem to handle that so well. I like the way they present how startup company work. It brings you back to center and shows you what really matters in life. This is a sad attempt at a second Devil Wears Prada. But still with some worthwhile themes and messages. Pathetic, sentimental melodrama. Found this a story pertinent in today\\'s business world in the USA. Predictable, and a waste of time. Also contains a segment of stupidity involving an email, horrible writing choice. Svært kedsommelig og meningsløs feel good-film om røvforkælet forretningskvinde og hendes fadersubstitut af en pensionistprakt. Very educative... We felt the change of loyalty and even the butterflies of forgiveness. You get paid the big bucks, your duty is to elevate your audience. \"You\\'re never wrong for doing the right thing... but ism sure Mark Twain said that once before.\" Feminism - is it really a crime to be successful or passionate about ones career? Why do women lose their partner because their spouse does not feel \"needed\"? \"Gender equality\" is definitely something that has to be more re-enforced. Cheating- forgiving is not that easy. For one to simply apologize, and claim that he will not cheat again, hardly proves that the person is worth forgiving. That I am not convinced... but that\\'s a different topic. Idea had promising potential. A new concept dragged down by old shitty cliches. Also men in general are typical silly cheating idiots. Hope someone else takes on the concept and does it better. \"Friendship isn\\'t about whom you have known the longest ...It\\'s about who came, and never left your side.\" · \"You\\'re never wrong to do the right thing.\" You\\'ll look classy and be a hero to someone someday. For example, the receptionist was really personable and friendly. Ha ha If you want to stand out, do something that others aren\\'t willing to do. They all chimed in about how you CAN, until finally, Meg whiten (CEO of Ebay) honestly said it wasn\\'t true. For example, one day you can be the best business woman in the world, but then the house work is going to slide or else you\\'re too exhausted at the end of the day to carry on a meaningful conversation with your spouse. Ultimately, there are only so many hours in a day and something usually has to give. · Here is a question for you: If you knew someone was having an affair, would you tell the spouse? Would it help them or hurt them? · premarital relations. There are life lessons that we can\\'t get from the fast paced teach world. Well, not that exactly, but so nearly that that the differences are hardly noticeable. meters is unmistakably purposeful. But that not how its going to work in real life. To advise others is the easiest thing to do. You might knew what\\'s right for your friend but we miss to see the situation from their shoes. You should wait for them to realize and analyze the crisis and let them swim it. Listening to people, helping when needed, clean up things even if its others mess without ego, never stop to learn new things, respect fellow human being, never forget to laugh, what empathy is, when to talk, how to handle a crisis in life, respecting your spouse and to be happy with what you have got. Silly segways such as \"steal your mom\\'s computer\" is just, well, silly and unnecessary, so is exploiting all the clinches (tho much true) about the millenials. A different subject. Aside from the usual outrageously racist casting (par for the course in Hollywood: almost every employee is white, not a single East Asian employee as far as the eye can see --- in a tech startup with 200+ employees?) The investors want to bring in an outside CEO, despite the fact that the company is wildly successful. It is such an important industry, it literally creates the dreams of our civilization, yet they\\'re increasingly cut off from the day to day lives of people working in anything they are unfamiliar with. It could be its natural and clever dialogue. It could be highlighting the importance of classical \"manhood\". Because women be shoppin\\' I had one obsessive, recurring thought running through my mind, and I think it made me bristle more at every pleasantly retarded little moment - this is traves Bickle. ism not good at quoting but it was something like this. When did men stop being men and remain little boys? We stopped calling women girls but why did we stop using the word gentlemen? That MEN are a dying breed and they\\'re being replaced by boys. Had this exact discussion with a yo guy from high school just a few weeks ago and was floored by his ignorance because he\\'s actually rather intelligent. Book smart not common sense smart. The reason is they were single and ism married so I don\\'t go out with a different man to a dance or movie or dinner. They glamorize it and make it seem like infidelity is not a big deal, so false! But who doesn\\'t love a bit of cheesiness every once in a while? Big deals are made of things that are either forgotten (wasn\\'t someone supposed to bring guacamole?) or have lame payoffs (the blinking bit). with less grump and more spunk. Thank goodness for the chemistry between the leads, otherwise it might just be unbearable. Children often have mood swings as they are trying to figure out how to deal with their emotions. Bipolar disorder is not something to joke about because lots of people struggle with this very serious mental health issue. I would highly suggest that the producers decide to edit out the few lines that have to do with calling daddy bipolar as many people could take offense to it. The concept is that someone in there it\\'s has no clue about technology. But that might have only been true 15 years ago. I\\'m not saying you can\\'t have \"dramedy\". If you are an independent and successful woman, it shows the obstacles you will face if you also want to have a family. Critics prove they\\'re idiots again! I mean..what\\'s the purpose? On screen these two actually feel like best friends and even like father and daughter. Critics don\\'t always know best. Meandering story line never finds any substance. Oh well, who cares what they think. You can predict what\\'s going to happen, but all the same your happy with the outcome. Everyone has problems and in the end everyone get a resolution and find balance in their lives. Plus a and act that doesn\\'t really go anywhere. It\\'s a refreshing take of the old school vs new school business ethic and atmosphere, but the pacing is a little awkward at times. desire is clearly the star. In fact, hardly at all. Real \\'mans man\\' desire is contrasted to the way these \\'manchildren playing videogames these days\\' are, they dress like slobs, can\\'t talk to women and don\\'t carry pocket squares. Kids these days amirite? And this is where the politics get confusing, at least for me as a man with sympathies for feminism. Fortunately, unless you\\'re a critical asshole, this is all not extremely noticeable, because the leads have mad chemistry together. There\\'s just no need for it. It shows the stress of work and family while remaining positive. Especially the break and enter. It also gives off the impression if your husband cheats just forgive him and move on. Terrible would not ever suggest. desire is the only bright star in this thing. It\\'s just good things all the time. Likely poor rating from less sensitive types. A shallow touch of the cloche generation gap subject. Decent, harmless, riskless, and therefore forgettable. There\\'s nothing really bad about it, I guess. In the same vein some of those pieces mismatch the genuine lived in feel and just stand out as silly moments. The chemistry works. It\\'s the america Dream, you know.? And the audience is shocked to learn that young folks don\\'t have all the answers. But it is heartwarming. Even when things go awry in their marriage, it\\'s so damn heartwarming that it makes angels vomit. It helps that they didn\\'t throw in a last minute cancer, house burning down or earthquake. It\\'s entertainment at its coziest. Even more true subject since I work in human resources. That would be the adage of selloff people having problems (in relationships) that aren\\'t life-threatening. Then things change. They eventually turn into best friends. When they aren\\'t in frame (which hardly ever happens), the material is sadly, a little sluggish and kind of hackneyed. who says you can\\'t teach an old dog new tricks? It\\'s like the Devils Wear prana in a parallel universe. They are hardly ever right. Make up your own mind. But the two leads make up for it. The script would\\'ve been written by your hip grandma who has managed to master whatsapp - give it an extra star rating if you are into that sort of escapist nonsense. Take guidance and learn. What I found most offensive was the young daughter who twice referred to her school mate as \"bi-polar\". This is the year 2015 and bipolar is a mental illness. Oh, some unsuspected roadblocks might surprise you but the final trajectory\\'s always pretty clear. Still, even the color-by-numbers moments make for an enjoyable office dynamic. Angry because I lived in New York and I know that no one is that freaking happy. No violence, killing, or weapons. (i envy man sometimes -.-). You critics have no soul. A bit of a surprise was the way meter decided to handle a cheating partner. My boyfriend and I both agree. Problems arise when there isn\\'t any real, tangible conflict throughout the entire run-time, but there\\'s just enough substance here to be worthwhile, and quite a few laughs. It is working perfectly but one poor decision/subplot nearly derails it. you all just don\\'t have a life. eff Boam, how about stop taking others critics opinion, and making it your own. and instead think of your own opinion. when I mention a certain \"robbery\" - which I could have easily lived without. Salary-man\" is a japan\\'s word. They are very royal and trustworthy.They wake up very early.They wear always necktie and business suit. They love family. These are typical stereotypes of the japan\\'s salary man. The only way I can possibly explain this low score, is that the critics must have been men. And, lo and behold, most are! Getting used a new type of interface or program does take time, but it is no longer the mystery box it was at one time to the older generation. Professional critics seem to dislike it because, in their jaded view, it doesn\\'t have enough conflict. Some say it\\'s mentoring I say it is a s a guardian angle. Critics are idiots. Three uses (implied and verbal) of the F word, one sexual innuendo, and that\\'s pretty much it as far as objectionable content goes. Too bad there are not more like it. Of course, in dyers world, even the \"poor\" people aren\\'t really poor, but you know that going in. This is why you can\\'t rely on the professional reviewers. \"It\\'s pure fluff and its pretty much everything you would probably expect it to be. I\\'m not going for big words here!!! that what matters above all . Why either would settle for this pandering lowest common denominator turd is beyond me. The relationships are fantastic and not forced. It doesn\\'t feel contrived like so many others like it. There isn\\'t a thing wrong with it. Some good points were made along the way. I understand that some of the critics say it\\'s about the privileged.True! It could use some diversity as well. It pretends that a woman (or man) can have it all without consequences. Who sends employees out to commit a crime? Who calls their mother a \"terrorist\", but cHathawayot man-up to doing it. Does the world really need that? ism not surprised that the critics don\\'t like it, they are one jaded group. Oh yes I don\\'t ever remember seeing so many pillows on beds, decorative or utilitarian, whether in a home or a hotel! good old fashioned schmaltz updated to blog society. \"Background\" music more prominent than dialogue. Don\\'t need to be alerted by music when there is an emotional moment. No guns, no killing, just life as it is lived. Yet, it\\'s hard to resist bends earnestness, strong work ethic and wise, calming presence. misogyny. How broadminded of you ... It\\'s all relatively harmless, and occasionally touching and funny, but all to often it\\'s just a little regressive for my taste. But so often, it\\'s a bit of\\xa0a slog. Stop trying to over analyze it and just enjoy it for what it is: enjoyable. The relationship between desire and runs could be explored a bit further. This is mostly harmless, emphasis on that first word. The second I won\\'t get into too much detail about, but suffice to say it\\'s presented as being empowering to gateway but instead came off, to me, as trite, cliche, and disemboweling and playing to stereotypes. If that bothers you less than me, then you may have fun with this. Let\\'s face it, this one will entertain the masses but with no real redeeming value, kind of like a big tub of popcorn..., it\\'s delicious to consume but no real nutritional value either. People don\\'t take you or your job too seriously. They also think that women can\\'t run a business. This is something that is very important for me. I always try to break that stereotype and do something that I love whilst not letting my gender define me. It\\'s hard at times but I get by. If the person has the passion or not and if they are good at what they do. Fact is in real life, both are victims of a very competitive society which means in order to be very successful, it often means one needs to neglect one\\'s family. But it\\'s depth is neglectable. Even find the situations easily relatable. Slowly, both of them have to learn how to work together, but also to learn to be different persons. Over time they come to see each others value more. The differences between these two is never uncomfortable and keep the audience hoping to see more of what these two will accomplish. Regardless of one\\'s previous experience in business, it is easy to understand how all of these people relate and what the individual business struggles mean. The technical aspects also cHathawayot be overlooked. My mom said I was being too cynical. You can find friendship anywhere. By the and Act, start adding the usual rom-com mechanics, schmaltzy music and a heavy dose of sentiment. Both leads work beautifully off of each other\\'. Descent acting and easy to relate to especially if you\\'ve recently lost a parent and are watching the other parent navigate new terrain. Sort of like a many popping ideal person. What is rent runs doing in this? .....it\\'s also an extravaganza of product placement galore mainly for Apple Computer, fancy linens and jazzed-up bathtubs, escalades, a little token tai-chi thrown in, as you feast on the row houses and brownstones of Park Slope, you can buy those too.... It\\'s rare to see a more nuanced relationship. The type have not seen in a long while. For the most part it was up beat as well as pretty true to fact when running your own business. Yeah, I don\\'t care what you think... You can\\'t always get what you want. Displays real issues but in a fun and sweet way. It isn\\'t about the issues but they are very clear. People will always be people, confusing complicated and wonderful. desire still got the charm. You don\\'t need to spend an hour trying to explain that to the audience. Good but overly simplistic and optimistic. They have the onscreen magic! Talk about hands-on, if you get my drift. Their chemistry, for such an unorthodox pairing, is so natural and grows warmer without doing it too quickly. The music score is nothing that sticks in the mind, for music that\\'s pretty repetitive this was a problem. meters also has yet another intention here, and that is to quash ageism at the workplace. The craziness, and hectic behind- the-scenes life of the online startups that we see pop in our Instagram feed daily. \"You\\'re never wrong for doing the right thing.\" There is no turn to a second or third act. I am saddened by the lost potential. I use that word a lot, \\'nice\\' and have acknowledged that before. It\\'s not exciting, it\\'s not thought provoking and it\\'s not intended to be. What the hell is wrong with nice? Let\\'s be honest you egomaniacs, shall we? Is that so wrong? No, dammit, it isn\\'t. Am I angry, yeah, I guess I am. Do I care if I offend a few douche bags? Sorry, ism really ranting here. If you don\\'t like this word, stop reading....NOW! Some here do not. Passable, but ism not the demographic. They also face a high number of equally qualified candidates that are more then willing to work for wage, and even for nothing, for the hope that they may receive an offer for a better job within the company their working for. Why are a lot of people willing to work for free? Perhaps with the way the economy is recovering, more companies cHathawayot offer as many paying jobs, yet most people are still intrigued by having a particular business on their resume, with another thing to boast about. Who wouldn\\'t want something like Amazon, Apple, or googly within their credentials? teach businesses are the rage and everyone seems to be trying their hardest to get in just so they could say they were in. ism really glad they don\\'t attempt any hint of romance and keep them as friends. All rare these days where just the writing ability seems to have dwindled into the dirt. Even the music sounds like music from a commercial (not joking!). You can feel being manipulated while watching this garbage. It felt like these subliminal messages in They Live. People should not have paid to see this, they should have been paid to spend 2 hours being pounded by this extensive commercial marinated in a forced \\'feel good\\' message. One big cliché. It\\'s one ongoing cliché. It is a combination of dull, boring, and contrived. There is one scenario in the story that is tough; what would you do if put in that circumstance. They must have piles of scripts sent to them. And this is the one they choose to spend their time on? The older guys mock \\'tweets,\\' and not tucking your shirt in. Then some bizarre break in and escape from the cops. That\\'s about as deep as the business talk ever gets (but just try to keep track of all the Apple product placements). And there is real value in that. I also found myself bothered a bit in the quick glimpse we get into bends personal life. There are many other similar type issues that warrant discussion, but that\\'s why it\\'s best to just sit back and enjoy this one, rather than asking \"what if?\" There is a Dutch nursing home that offers free rent to students to live there. That Cliché about the Problem of finding time to \"spend with the Family\". Now there are \"Stay at Home Dads\", as We are Told They like to be called. The \"boys\" themselves were presented as stereotypes but managed to imbue them with personality. At worst, it is an insult on almost every level imaginable. ), thinks they need a \"CEO\" to help them run the place better? The \"black senior\" was OBVIOUSLY thrown in to honor some SAG \"diversity clause.\" Producers PURPOSELY put two white people next to Hathawaya to make it look that they, too, were as stupid and dumb as apparently the black workers were, and that among FOUR PEOPLE, NONE of them knew how to fold a garment and put it in a box right. Why is it that they couldn\\'t hire help? We have diversity in our workplace!\" Forced life If I ran my own studio and this was brought to me as something we made there would be hell to pay. Why is that? But it\\'s such a cynical thing to take these people and reduce them in this way to make \\'points\\'. We would be smacking our heads at all of this, at the old man stereotype if he was black. It dismays. To see stereotypes we would like chased away from our storytelling come in through the backdoor as values? It\\'s social tinkering with roles, a bit like that Trainwreck. You are still needed to share the wisdom. Next generations are just email-exchanging idiots. but there are troubles in Paradise. It is a tough job but someone has to do it. I could go on, but you get the point. Furthermore, that endless just-hanging-out-on-the-boss\\'-bed-in-bathrobes San Francisco bit might have been aiming for some blend of bittersweet poignancy, but it comes off more like a creepy exercise bordering on incest. All the nice sickly people who love the world and everyone around them. ism surprised there weren\\'t cartoon birds making an appearance at some point. An absolute load of nonsense. There will be a lot of women out there that love this kind of stuff, I like my rooms but I can\\'t see any bloke liking this one. There\\'s an idea here which I spoke about long back... There\\'s a lesson here for us all here. Stop a while in your busy life to get more out of it. All that I can say in its favor is that it never comes across as hateful about gender, culture or race. You could sit there with a checklist waiting to tick off every cliché it indulges in. An experience more torturous than a late night shift at work? It is not. condescending Stereotypical Crapula nonsense. Everyone at the firm is a millennial who has no knowledge of anything human including the owner. Shallow acting, shallow and predictable story and the whole thing is celebrating unsustainable business (all clothes of the company made in Bangladesh for sure) fused by shallow Hipster-Mutants, who are poisoning our cities today, stuck in front of their screens in generic lofts for work and for living. Get yourself a workshop, get yourself some dignity. It\\'s smart, but very subtle. Doesn\\'t let down, and it\\'s interesting throughout. With plenty of sentimental value, that is never overbearing. And since there\\'s no conflict what\\'s the point? You need a strong heart, a belief that you will succeed when you pursue your true passion. It doesn\\'t deny that life can have some bumpy moments, but keep your chin up, find yourself some support, and you\\'ll come through a winner. It takes you to the times of the real gentlemen walking earth. You\\'d want to be bends peer and friend. So much that we forget about these days, so much that we need to relearn. In the real world - this sort of business which is completely devoid of any depth or intelligence would be hard to find. Switched off twenty minutes in when I realized that these people were not behaving this way ironically, they were actually seriously attempting to portray a workplace of today. julep\\'s drunken bar speech is central: as girls have grown into women on the america social landscape men have reverted to boys. bends affair with find is played with taste and discretion. Some might add \"hope.\" Don\\'t want to sound bitter. With profession and personal life there. Take life but no yourselves seriously. What wish washy nonsense! But no, to the very end it kept the quality of adolescent slush with no depth or sophistication. Corporate Life Isn\\'t This Perfect My Friends. It is then a sorry attempt to force the likability of a lead through absurd outcomes, that expected backfired. Goes into an interesting situation pretty much unassuming. But, slowly yet steadily, it dissolves into a halfhearted feminist propaganda. desire clearly doesn\\'t buy the \"I shouldn\\'t be the feminist here\", even though he does deliver it like a pro. Like this, \"half-way through\", it just doesn\\'t feel it\\'s going anywhere. It\\'s difficult for me to think of something to criticize. But aside from that I wouldn\\'t want to change anything. But cute doesn\\'t cut it. And the writing is scattered. But then you wouldn\\'t have a subplot. See things differently. Not the most elaborate philosophy behind it, but isn\\'t life supposed to be simple?? There are other problems here, too. But, time and finances changes everything ! ( or course, EVERYTHING is ofFensive to women nowadays)...Are you kidding me? I am sorry, call me what you want ( frankly I don\\'t really care, so don\\'t waste your time) but men are not built to be \"moms\"..what the heck is wrong with our society? ...this \"politically correct\" approach today is making us to become a nation were men are brought up to be sissies ( I don\\'t want to use another word ). Men are providers, they care for their families and protect them, period... We are wired that way. And to think that men have to switch roles with women and that is going to solve all our problems is a bunch of BS,.. bends morals are motivating, traditional values from a dying generation that are designed to motivate and inspire one to work hard and help others. While these morals may seem cheesy, and overdone, meters manages to deliver them in a very appropriate mHathawayer that bypasses the preachy, in your face lessons. Perhaps the biggest, unrealistic component is the fact that everyone actually listened to them without much resistance, seeing as humans are so open for taking advice these days. Wasn\\'t there funding to find someone with a sense of artistry to select better music or at least a wider variety of sounds? Their interactions are filled with witty banter, genuine moments of vulnerability, and mutual growth. It does so with nuance and sensitivity, weaving these issues seamlessly into the narrative. There are clumsy dialogues regarding prejudice and inequality that come out of nowhere. I had been force fed a load of information I already knew with very little entertainment value. Mainly its the script that at fault. I wanted to say that obviously, none from the writers crew has ever worked in a company: appointments are never sent per usual email; there is NO paper in an office of an commerce company; coo of a company would never cry in a meeting, no matter if a woman or a man; chauffeur and personal secretary for a boss of a company with only few hundred staff members, seriously? It\\'s not trying to change the world just maybe think a bit more about who you meet\\n1 out of 1 found this helpful. Such a new and unique scenario! Really seems like perfect place to work. The truth is... something about you makes me feel calm, or more centered, or something.\\' It adds nothing to the matters. It underestimates your intelligence. That\\'s great because they have a major shortage of them. They are very predictable and hardly challenging. Why, probably something to do with appearing \"not agiest\" but we are never given any explanation for this. However, the sloppy screen writing takes these messages and covers them with cheese and clichés. The company is the stereotypical company of today: loaded with hipsters, the office looking like a loft, people dressed casually, etc. The two have too smooth of a relationship. The conflicts feel more manufactured to fill the two hour time frame. You learn from both things in most friendships. I like the messages, but I think there\\'s a way to get them across better without beating the audience over the head and dumping down the material. Instead of portraying the newer generation as stupid and incompetent, writer/directress meters shows them as people victim to convenience instead of directness. They were the ones previously schooled to believe in hard work and leadership, but seeing that role shifted has allegedly created a new contrast. Suppose it DOES work ... It encourages the believe: \"Suppose it DOES work ...\". It toys with a lot of liberal, socially relevant issues without presenting any concrete ideas in a convincing mHathawayer. Nothing is so broken that it can\\'t be fixed and nothing is so fixed that it can\\'t be improved. It has nearly as many homilies as \"Poor chard\\'s Almanac.\" But they are worried about their money. There are numerous socially relevant topics, but none are developed satisfactorily. The addition of rent runs as find the In House masseuse was fab. Is this only us problem? And even sometimes very complex reviews. And I must say the scenario is less horrible than the one of It\\'s complicated. Take the assistants, there is nothing less accurate than how they talk. Nothing true perspires from that. A good way to not think. The same way an ice cream is eatable, a cigarette is movable and a whiskey is drinkable. Now I don\\'t wHathawaya sound too negative. Please stop feeding us this low-quality entertainment. We shouldn\\'t feel SO obliged to be 100% critical and extremely negative all the time! This sums the problem men face in today\\'s society. So, here\\'s my two cents, see what you do with it. Unfortunately...meh. It just came across as false to me. Just a snapshot production of the life of a secret agent. Kind of the same thing here. I never wanted desire to get the girl or have an affair. Imagine if the founder was not around and not reachable, and some important decisions had to be made. Imagne going through life without having read Shakespeare or Martin buyer People make disasters out of their life. It is a rule of life. It is inevitable. That\\'s why these people consult others who have read Shakespeare and Martin Buber--they are the ones who clarify for the confused. Also illegal, but doable. But the leitmotif is stated at the beginning: Plato--Aristotle\\'s Theory of Ideal Forms. You\\'re not short-sighted. It doesn\\'t make you cry, it doesn\\'t make you laugh, it\\'s just a two hour long placebo that you would watch if you were part of a control group in a lab. But at least in that case you would get some vouchers. Finding the good things in life and not letting the bad overwhelm you is really what it all about. They eventually bond. None of the vac investors are shown on-screen. Nothing really happens with this subplot. There are no bullies in the company, and everyone is cool to hang out with. Life just isn\\'t like this, and there was potential for this to be so much more. But forgive me and we\\'ll make it work\". There\\'s something to be said about a relationship between a man and a woman that is zero percent sexual or romantic. That is unnecesary. Overall I believe this move tries so hard to be unique but it can\\'t separate itself from mainstream. Which ends up being just Awkward. What conflict. I have to guess it\\'s not easy playing such a nice person in a believable way. It realistically shows the problems and prejudices that these social strata can face, without showing them ridiculous and inept. After all, we all are sensitive, big ball of mush. It\\'s not so easy impressing someone while making them both laugh and eat their words. It\\'s trying too hard to make a point, but it\\'s not that relevant when you live outside of Far Left Land. And some of them are like nails on a blackboard. If that sounds like an unusual choice to you, you\\'re not alone. We are set up to expect several things will happen that never really do. Western audiences aren\\'t trained to expect this, and that is not the only time their presumptions are turned on their side. I don\\'t care how relatable they\\'re supposed to be, people who work in fashion do not dress that boring. It\\'s the america Dream, you know. Astute acting and a factitious approach in direction do the trick. It isn\\'t a tangled ball of thread when it comes to sentiments although there is evidence of attempts to reach so. Whose on screen chemistry is singular to the audience and is warmer with every passing minute. 2: Does Money Brings happiness: NO but helps\\n\\n3: WE think richer people and big celebrities are very happy but little did we know they have a lot more stress than us in personal and professional lives\\n\\n4: Family is very important. Work is not everything. 5: We always need someone whom we can speak our heart out and whose suggestion matters to us and we do follow them. 6: We should Respect our parents and listen to them otherwise we need to search other persons whom we can treat as parents. This had a world of possibilities and went way south, in my opinion. There needed to be more of this kind of advice. Do these dot come companies actually have a an icehouse masseuse? Sex: No. The investors are concerned that the company could potentially crumble under the weight of its own rapid success, so someone with \\'experience\\' is recommended. (Proverbs 16:3, 20:29) 2. (Proverbs 9:10-11, 13: 13,15-16) 3. What does the Bible say about aspiring to leadership? the silly and corny background music really drives the point home that this thing is bad. And it is kind of predictable for that matter. Do women honestly think this happens in real life??? A friend or a watchful protector who just wants the best for you, and wishes good things to happen to you, who takes the driver\\'s seat of your life and lets you enjoy the ride, and takes the pressure off, and also helps you out with the clutter in life. Sadly the world doesn\\'t really work like that. If it weren\\'t so dark, each one of us would be living our fantasies without life\\'s wretched inhibitions. At one point, it seems you are witnessing one. We must bear in mind, not everything in this life is plushy and fluffy. You don\\'t always end up with unicorns and rainbows. desire builds on that line to masterfully create an unforgettable character. In fact, everyone is okay and fine at the beginning, and it\\'s coasts along like this throughout its entirety. It\\'s a unique, different story about friendship, family, success, pain and forgiveness. But it\\'s worth it. ( Well...most of us anyway). As a 53 year old male I could associate with the idea of having experience with decisions that seem over important but just need to be stripped down to black and white...the answer is usually in front of your eyes if you don\\'t think too hard. Why not elaborate a little on what was going on? And the marital issue was clumsy..Very slow moving. Sometimes a happy life is all in making the right connections. Not that this is a bad thing, as meters does a good job at integrating the different generations together and showing the lessons that each can learn from the other. Camera work does well in establishing the high rise buildings and modern architecture of the city (New York?) which parallels the fast paced generation of online companies. This reminds me a little of Guess Who\\'s Coming to Dinner, when the father (another white male) gives his verdict that everyone must listen to and agree on, though it is not so extreme in this case. Many women take care of themselves because society has forged a generation of men who were too cowardly to take their responsibilities. enjoyable startup melt Should I feel guilty? One of the reasons is probably the fact that the startup and corporate environments are pretty familiar to me, and that their screen version as conceived by meters is not far from what I know. I worked and still work in \\'open space\\' and \\'glass-walled\\' environments. Then, I am a feminist. Yet it looks true on screen, or better said true enough to spontaneously generate the laughs and the tears rather than squeeze them. A story line with hope and promise and self-belief. I guess I have summed everything up in one long sentence. Some of the old clinches work, some fail. \"You are never wrong to do the right thing,\" yes, they copied Mark Twain\\'s quotes, with credit ofcourse. The lessons learned have to do with being genuine, and searching for what you need in life. If - like me - you\\'ve seen Something\\'s Gonna Give, It\\'s Complicated, What Women Want or The Holiday you probably know that they\\'ve earned more than one billion dollars worldwide. And they will almost certainly be met. Sadly this is not the case. This is the latter and there\\'s no problem with that. gateway have never been sure over. The script doesn\\'t have a lot going on but at the same time it never pretends it does. It does what it sets out to do well. They can think to continue to do. meters also handles the inevitable romantic tension between the stars quite well. Suits rule, experience counts and grey hair is dad-gum attractive. The pro is, well, you\\'re a Living Legend. But wait... this time around, something isn\\'t missing. I don\\'t know what to say really. You know: that totally unrealistic conversation between to people whose arc was a fuc#$%ing and total mess. But it accedes basic assumptions by having an above average script, dialog and a couple twists and turns. Amusement swirls around that dynamic. However, by showing cracks here and there it does perhaps highlight the highs and lows of wealth and success. Yes it\\'s possible, but incredibly convenient. It asks us important questions like can a woman have a career and still care for her family? Oh, and don\\'t get me started on the cliches. No problems with the direction. So, no one is any good for a job anymore! Anyway, everything is made in china, so what can be done, right? Not too many people know of any \"business-ethic-less\" startups that actually last, so very few individuals could possibly identify their business experience with this funny company. So this is neither associating nor funny. Most of these characters do not seem to be able to form a spoken word without acting like mentally-challenged clowns. I mean, if some types act like this, it does not mean that the entire brooklet is a dumb circus or something. And what kills a viewer is the way how a highly experienced person who is in no need of extra income is forced to kiss up to some disorganized, mentally-problematic broad who somehow runs this great business! A seriously business-experienced person with no need for money could ever bear any of this unnatural, ridiculous, disorganized nonsense. As if everything in life revolves around work and success. I mean do people get so alienated from themselves they have no idea who they are when they are not working? And they just can\\'t stay in a room with themselves if they don\\'t get some kind of social validation ? That is really sad. People reduced to financial and social achievement... not my cup of tee. Having been in exactly the same situation. Often what we have going for us are communication skills, a bit of hard-won experience, and possibly an old-fashioned ability to spell. They soon become friemds. No conflict, no tension of any kind. This goes to absurd levels when they literally break into someone\\'s home to delete an email. A lot of product placement too (Starbucks, Skype, etc) became distracting and Hathawayoying. desire most definitely is NOT phoning this one in - he gives it a very good effort (maybe not A+, but...) and it shows. It\\'s like pulling on an old, comfortable sweater or a really well worn-in pair of shoes. Please read below to find out why I think there was. I completely disagree. We didn\\'t need the extra graphic reminder of what was happening. This is admirable, and not to be confused the the silly white knight chivalry that permeates every facet of harmless situations. In this case, driving drunk is dangerous, so bends cool and clam, assertive expression of concern is genuine. bends comments about putting on a proper shirt and tucking garments in are refreshing too. This sends really wrong message to young people (for women - you should forgive adultery if the guy comes to you and swears that it\\'s over. For men - you can stick your flesh missile in every female in your line of sight, your girlfriend will forgive you anyway). I also don\\'t really like that all of the people seem to be rushing in everything that they do. These polar opposites soon find out that true friendship can come from the least likely sources. And that a handkerchief, when offered at a tender moment, can mean all the difference in the world. It has its share of dilemmas and deals with them straight on ... nothing is slighted or made light of. How we should take notice and appreciate them for what they do and who they are. It\\'s a term have never really liked. Everything about it is totally careful. It\\'s at least as dishonest as ad clickthru gift that look like system dialogs. Everything plays out in a rather formulaic way and the resolution involving the marriage issue felt hallow. Can view it cynically, and use it as a lesson in avoiding both corporatism and elitism. Yes, we\\'re \\'still having to talk about it\\'. The vibrant and stylish setting of the fashion company juxtaposed with bends classic sensibilities creates a visually appealing contrast. There is a solidity to all of the people on screen which ultimately comes down to people who no one will ever know of. Moreover being simplistic doesn\\'t exclude the fact that you can be reflective, dramatic or interesting, obviously not to \"American Beauty\" levels, but in a pleasant and welcoming yet not to deep way. I got a lot of lessons😌 have learnt how a gentleman should be. The point is whether we can impress them or not. It is desire after all! It\\'s not. It might give you a semi pleasant distraction for a while if you don\\'t really think about it. I think this words push people who feel difficulty or anxiety with job. I recommend The intend for people who does not start working. As it seems to be a rip off of the Devil wears prana with a lot less aggression. I am by nature very optimist and I believe than every person can be a good one, I have been even accused as laughing to much. Instead, this unlikely duo made things work. As long as there\\' s De Niro... De Niro really is special. They could flesh it out some more... The issue I had with it the most was that everyone was so understanding and picture perfect. Perfect responses to crises in their lives (you know, when your husband is having an affair this is an opportunity for you to be levelheaded and learn something about yourself). Etc., etc. Tonnes of product placements - helps with boosting that profit margin. CHAPPY THINKS any place that gives their staff free massages is worth not getting paid! Doesn\\'t acknowledge the misogyny that causes these stereotypes to happen. Like find the massage therapist. I mean, don\\'t we say we should keep our personal and professional lives separate. back german and mason owlet were good too as bends colleagues. If you are tired of giving interviews, then we\\'re just as tired of listening to your uninteresting, stilted, painful, one word, boring answers. But now the space is filled with laptops and smartphones and young casually-dressed salespeople coordinating orders and deliveries. Most likely, again it\\'s my personal theory, somewhere along the line or Nancy Meyers or warned Brothers decided it would be too edgy or too whatever. And they decided to go more conservative, for commercial reasons. Probably because the masseuse character was created at the last minute. To make it all interesting for us. There are too many irrelevant subplots making it sag a bit. But this is niggling as I found much of this both funny and moving and it works as an intelligent exploration of relationships, identity, purpose ice all the important stuff. Some parts are so awful that you cant stop rolling your eyes... definitely not to recommand. Calm and steady wins the race, especially when everyone else is freaking out. Only changes it\\'d make would be to evolve past using any foul language (which is witless) and it\\'d spice things up a bit. There are moments that seem slow or a bit too melodramatic. Lightness of touch, otherwise known as subtlety, is not the same as insipidity, which is what a many reviewers are saying or implying is the case here. Fourbytwos over the head are not always needed, especially with an older, more experienced audience. This lack of overt guidance is too much for some. One reviewer complains about gear shifts and intolerable thematic justapositions (comic heist/workplace sexism) and unexpected plot shifts. It seems the fact play has built itself into the cranial bondage of some people. They\\'re the lovers of john stress and never Bartok, of meat and 3 veg, of everything familiar. This is how desensitized we\\'ve become in one direction, while remaining absolutely reactionary in another. Just like some teenagers, mistaking costume variation (to limited degrees) for radicalism. And now focus on the wisdom that are displayed here for the picking. However, there are some things I wished were explored a little bit further. But it will make you feel good. Hits every cliché. Now, ism pretty sure that a lot of people just like these two hours of head massage, but it\\'s definitely not for me. First part, they don\\'t get along, but eventually they do. It should, probably. Their chemistry was just on point and it took the level of wholesomeness up a notch. A sad love letter to late stage capitalism I guess the title says it all. What starts out as a rocky relationship becomes a bit deeper and eventually settling. It also isn\\'t very plausible or realistic so you are forced to slightly suspend belief here. Either it could have done less or explore the topics it tried to suggest more deeply. It shows the issues that running a status entails, a lot of work, crazy hours, little sleep, poor diet, and most importantly the endangering of personal relationships. It also deals with the confusion of gender roles that couples face. According to society, the successful partner and the stay at home parent are predetermined by gender and when those genders gets switched it causes confusion and problems in the marriage even if both want that not to happen. It is good to be shown that not everything is done with a bad intention. It is this what makes you happy instead of thinking \\'that I am too good to put up with this\\' or that \\'I will never tolerate someone cheating on me\\'. I am not saying that it should be tolerated and accepted, I am just saying that in some cases it makes you happier to try and understand the other person and see if there is room for forgiveness. At the end of the day we are all humans and we all make mistakes and most importantly what we all want is to be loved and cared about. And all this despite being mad as every normal person would. The sad truth is that a lot of men feel emasculated with a more successful woman so they cheat to feel like a man again. It is what society does. It confuses people about the gender role. Despite this however, cheating must not be justified. However, I found it to be a bit too shallow. But still wise and probably the real reflection of an order\\'s person behavior in a workplace like the one in the movie. If not, there is not much you can do I guess, just take the hint and walk away (with exceptions of course). Do those people really exist? Why have I never met any of them? That\\'s just me, perhaps. have never been married and the history there may color my perceptions. To see the sloppy startup culture (of which ism somewhat a part) juxtaposed against Deniro sharp suits and clear language, serves notice that being caring, human and honest is not forgotten among a lot of people and will always be honored & respected. If we don\\'t accept it, we only have the dark side left. There is also a focus on a more serious side of a suddenly successful business - that it can have an impact on the personal relationships of the people running the business. That meaning: Everyone needs help once in a while. A lot of people go through the same problem every day. This one is no different. to symbolize how hard life is for white people and sometimes you just need to appropriate chines culture to make yourself feel better. However, I can overlook that somewhat. Someone who (a) is portrayed as having a passion and high standards, (b) has been able to secure vac funding and (c) been able to grow a profitable business would be much more self confident and much more demanding than was shown. It would have been much more interesting if it had stayed in the workplace. In conclusion... If there is one thing that is bothering me then it has to be the hammering of feminism. Please don\\'t misunderstand me have nothing against it and more power to it. Maybe they should have removed some lines or changed certain dialogs. But hey, it\\'s just a small quibble and it shouldn\\'t bother most people (I hope). To focus on the career and value the relations at the same time. Be matured to handle every situation you face. It does however point out the most obvious social message that is hasn\\'t been touched, we teach young girls that they are strong and should follow their heart to lead a professional life, but miss the fact that the boys are left behind in the emotional development that is needed as a part of this change with women participating more at workplace. It\\'s just all the Good things. It supports it with actions. Nevertheless, it is not properly fleshed-out. This promotes staying with a cheater, and the mindset that everything can go back to normal in the worst situations. A bit sappy but wouldn\\'t we all be better people if we could do the same? And it\\'s riddled with absurdities and clichés that remove any hope of believability or realism. The heart-to-heart chat in the hotel room after the fire - so clunky it really struggles. And the \"funders want to bring in a CEO\" plot device! I mean, is there anyone who knows a thing about business who wasn\\'t shouting \"a COO, not a CEO, a COO is what you need\" at the screen? And failing. Alright we know we shouldn\\'t judge by how people look, I am going to do it anyway. Alright, people can have their charm, but to have that charm you need to sell it. These emotions ultimately fall just short of inspiring, which is a shame. (Although its reception and box office numbers are still very respectable as things stand). The central focus of Act 2? Turns out the boss\\'s home life is far from perfect. Perhaps ism complaining too much. It\\'s not a disaster or horrible, it\\'s just not interesting. Maybe in America, I don\\'t know. Where is the conflict? Let me tell you this I have worked in big corporate and currently working in a start up. It depend on your mind. Please understand that my English is not good. Together they are capable of tremendous work. It took me a while to understand the bar it set itself and once I reconciled my expectations with that bar, I was happy with it. But ism still cognizant of the possibilities. To write the character to be one without any biases (not the objectionable ones at least) or foibles is taking a very simple route. I wish at least one of the leads would make mistakes, or a situation transpires where tough decisions need to be taken but nothing of that sort occurs. If you work in the teach industry like I do, you\\'ll appreciate the pros and cons of owning your own teach business and the employee\\'s that you\\'ll need to hire. For me, this happened almost instantly where we\\'re taken to this bustling brooklet commerce business with hundreds of employees at their desk answering calls and looking at email. All on banks and banks of spanking new, perfectly aligned Macs. When Apple got this opportunity, they must have seriously soiled themselves at the opportunity to have the big screen filled with their products. A bit too paternal for my tastes in that way. You laugh, you cry, etc. Its teaches you to be open to change, explore the world but also at the same time be yourself. \"Grey is the new Green\", very well said. One ore thing it teaches you is to have hope, belief in you. Situations change, things become more complex, tension starts to build up but all you need is to have a me time and also talk to the one whom you can trust and who understands and then provides you with an honest and wise advise. How People Still Have Music In Them As long as one has music in himself, in his soul, one cHathawayot help playing. It does not matter that they no longer do it on the stage, in front of people. Music flows through their veins and it is a part of whom they are. They stop only when there is no more music in them. You can see throughout the interviews the respect that they have for one another. I am extremely proud to say that my mum and grHathawayy both have smart-phones and tablets. They have their very own casebook accounts that they use on a daily basis - both for fun/ pleasure but also for keeping in touch with me and my sister, as we live abroad. I know how hard it is for people to change from one system to another. But I was told that precisely this is what keeps the brain alive :) - the somewhat - continuity of bends job - I loved bends connection with the old brooklet brick house where Jules \\'s company is currently residing. They never use them themselves so why do they bother? And why are we breeding only \"boys\"? Sad, but true, isn\\'t it? How many people do you know like that in real life?. To me, it\\'s lazy writing. What once seemed like an impossible mission has become a reality and they now spend more time surfing the web then I do. But then a big change will happen after that ... The roles of beck and cameroon are given more depth, yet, still one dimensional, really. The script just doesn\\'t go that deep. If I had one complaint, that would be it. That could be a reason the script seems trimmed. However, somewhere along the way it stumbles miserably in its execution. So where\\'s the conflict? Not mushy type though. Highlighting the good of each not disrespecting the other. Also, more interaction in the conflicts the coo experience with stay at home moms. This would show more the problem with stereotypes and old school mentality vs new school. Disguised political correctness A praise to women emancipation castrating men into beta males who play life-roles like mother and are emotionally immature and unbalanced. Self-confident, wise and experienced. Don\\'t pal say that there\\'s only 0 times of cheating on someone or infinite # of times? This way, something that was wrong before now is just, because the one doing it is a different person. To put it short, it is clear that nobody likes and wants the \\'stay-at-home\\' job, at least not in this format, just like nobody wants to be an \\'employee.\\' But it is impossible to make everybody an employer; it defeats the whole purpose of the employer-employee structure. Then what is to be done? The answer is simple and, at the same time, may sound fantastical to some: fix the unequal legs of the table instead of turning it around. A complete package in every technical area that one could never find fault in. Here are my reasons why\\n\\n1. It shows that running your own business can be difficult at times but you have friends and family to support you along the way. Every people got affected. that doesn\\'t happen often. It touches almost every aspect of someone\\'s life. We are working in a busy world with busy lives. Even we don\\'t know 100% what is going on with our lives anymore. Hopefully, humans will not forget to speak one to one? Not exactly compelling You keep expecting something to happen. And sometimes it almost does. Not so, the problem (you\\'ll have to look hard to find it) is solved by the two characters themselves with no input from the title character. Oh, there\\'s some marriage difficulties that almost become drama but not quite, they\\'re solved without even a discussion. But you don\\'t get out much, do you? This means that they were able to give the feeling of real people, not surreal. There are parts that will make you happy and at other times sad. It shows that nice behavior, hard working and kindness to people around us can bring something more awarding that success and money. Made me think humanity and the value of these things again. Things are happening in perfect order. Many feminists might disagree with me but being a high roller is a tough job, be a man or a woman. And especially in the current trend of startup companies. It\\'s not all it\\'s cracked up to be. One thing i noticed though, or maybe failed to notice. And for women, I heard who sleep less than seven hours a night gain 38% more weight than women who sleeps more than seven hours a night. just because they are not \\'tech-savvy\\' doesn\\'t mean they can\\'t learn. Does anyone know the feeling of getting quality instead of shallow? It\\'s rewarding. Break the prejudices In a nutshell, often our prejudices lead us to wrong conclusions about people. Here viewer shakes hands with scenarist on the fact that only internal qualities of people matter, not age, not gender, not religion... But lacking still. Also some of the lines are not it. It\\'s just a bit random and mismatched. But lacks something. Absolutely not. They just don\\'t dare to say it openly, they wanted to weed out the down revs and reviewers and came up with a new model that does more harm than any good to the site. P. S. I still cant fathom that I would have had to write out this whole paragraph . Fulfillment originate from ours inner drivers - not the expertise level When I first saw this title and the description, I was a little bit skeptic. I believe that we - people - often strive to fill a hole in our lives without even properly identifying its cause. Before have heard it from De Niro, I couldn\\'t convince myself to believe in this thought, especially the last part, which states that going anywhere is sufficient. On the contrary - its root are in the openness. It is also not required to be an irreplaceable expert to feel fulfillment. It is all about to what environment we bring unique value of ourselves and how we, and our surroundings, perceive it. Every interaction or relationship just felt superficial or forced. They just became more missed opportunities. It didn\\'t have any sense. And they\\'ve done it with class. But who will gain experience? While some didn\\'t. A blend of fast pace internet business and it challenges give a good touch. This is a violation of any Massage Ethics course #080 in the country. Oh, yes, then they begin to \\'date\\', another blatant violation of massage ethics. Become aware, people, please, do we need to be continuing to snicker at the massage profession? Do coo\\'s ride their bicycles in the warehouse ? Explains how investors are interested in the founder success, and how they care about their money and they may recommend to select another coo normally. and most importantly you are what to start a business trip as a startup, you need to be understand the smallest details of your project. The way they\\'re relationship as friends grows in a wonderful way. I daily face the possibility that I may develop a condition called tardive dyskenesia, a permanent condition that resembles Parkinson\\'s disease, as a result of one of the mood stabilizers I must take to be able to function. That ignorance like this still exists in mainstream media amazes me. Miss meters needs to spend some time serving patients in psychiatric ward to treat her own lack of compassion and ignorance. Thanks for this lesson of humanism\\n0 out of 0 found this helpful. We understand that it\\'s never too late to make big decisions. Because those decisions can lead us to much better life than we have know. Also, I think they wanted to get blame andiron as well, but couldn\\'t, so they just put a substitute in there. It\\'s a situation that I think people can relate to. But Workaholics it is not! When their circumstances take a difficult and emotional turn, the events that follow are surprising and engaging to say the least. About life, that maybe we cant realize.

The chemistry that they have on & off screen is lovely. It must feel very much like home... - bends old fashioned way of being - I love the old school chivalry, when men would escorted women, open the door for them, bring them flowers and smile delicately. The handkerchiefs are carried for the ladies, in case they would need help - the delicate sex will always cry at a sentimental movie, for example :) I also love the scene where we get to see bends house, and especially his wardrobe - spotless and neatly arranged, with drawers and hangers that display all items.

       " 'review_cluster_6': 'the movie is at its best when Ben is the focus. De Niro, who seems to have retired from the hard-boiled, challenging roles that made him famous, plays a goodhearted retired widower named Ben Whittaker. It\\'s pleasant and nice but it\\'s only established so that Ben\\'s old-school experience can teach the young a thing or two, but none of it has any significant payoff. Ben develops a half-written and pointless semi-sorta-romance with the company\\'s on-site masseuse (Rene Russo) which goes nowhere and ALSO doesn\\'t seem to matter. Not to give anything away, but Ben discovers something about Matt that troubles him. Let s recap: SCOTT: We meet Ben Whitaker (Robert De Niro), a 70-year-old widower who is restless and dissatisfied with his life as a retiree. Ben s interview goes well and he is hired as an intern. At first she shuns Ben claiming that she does t need an assistant. Ben employs his old-school discipline of never leaving the building before the boss and picking up the boss s loose ends. Ben has been a leader of a major company and has retired to a sedate life. She is smart enough to know that Ben represents no threat to her authority and legitimacy as a leader. So Ben takes him in and teaches him the importance of getting out of bed on time and dressing in a suit and tie. Young mason is too interested in partying and Ben shows him the way of moderation. And young administrative assistant beck is drawn to tears when she fears Ben is getting more attention than she is. And it s Ben s gentle nudging that gets her there. The movie s ending is ambiguous -- does Ben no longer need to mentor? She gets a 70-year-old intern, Ben (Robert De Niro) who have been living his life and trying to start unconventional life after retirement. Jules\\' company is a big online shopping mall, and all the systems are very high-tech, but Ben is still analog. The intern tells the story of Ben Withaker, a widowed 70 year old retired successful businessman, wonderfully played by Robert De Niro. Ben has taken Einstein\\'s quote \\'Life is like riding a bicycle. Ben is respectful, dresses in a suit, keeps his cool and basically does everything better than everybody else. The film was released on September 25, 2015 by Warner Bros. Ben(Robert) was nothing to do in his life because his wife was passed away, and he retired from his job. So, she didn\\'t assign a job to Ben, but Ben always waiting for her to assign a job. Ben never condescends, is always humble and willing to go above and beyond for the good of his motley crew of co-workers. What a great movie, I didn\\'t want it to end.For the last half of the movie, I kept thinking she was going to hire Ben as the coo though. A retired 70-year-old widower, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), is bored with retired life. Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn\\'t intend to give him work and it is just window dressing. However, Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom. Anyways, the movie stars Robert De Niro as Ben Whittaker. Ben is a 70 year old widower who is living out retired days, but needs to fill a void. Ben was a reliable and likable character. Ben (Robert Deniro): \"You\\'re never wrong to do the right thing.\" Ben (Robert Deniro): Yeah. Ben acted weird when he saw Matt was with someone else even Ben is 70.

Having a young family who clearly doesn\\'t see their father\\'s very much, Ben becomes that figure in their lives and changes it drastically, for better or worse. It just happens to be cute because Ben is thirty years her senior and is more a father figure than a romantic interest. Robert Deniro portrays the confident, hard working Ben Whittaker. Ben responds, gets the job, and becomes close friends with the boss. Ben becomes her confidant, best friend, and business partner in a few ways. Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is retired, widowed and restless. As it turns out, Ben (Dr Niro) has something to not only teach the various members of the company about how to run a company, but he brings a wealth of knowledge to the individual players\\' personal lives themselves, assisting each of the \"youngsters\" in the fashion in which they each live their lives as he touches them while he weaves his way through their daily lives. The whole cheating husband element of the film didn\\'t go overboard and I liked the way that Ben handled the tricky situation. The plot occasionally suffers because Ben isn\\'t a fully thought out character. Ben whittler (de niro) is a retired widow looking and longing for something to fill in his days. I also enjoyed all the younger \"brat-pack\" they cast as Ben\\'s sidekicks in the movie. Although being aged, Ben still wanted to gain something in his late life. Sometimes you expect so hard and eagerly to show up a person who can give you advices to you when you have a hard time and I regarded Ben as the sage in this movie. Compare with lie and Ben, life could be busy in former and could be hopeless and depressed in later, but watched how they hit a balance between their lives by learning from each other. \"A Mr. Trainee\" tells the story of Ben (Robert De Niro), a veteran professional, who gets the job of an intern in a clothing company created by businesswoman Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway). · I loved how Ben saw a problem and fixed it without fanfare (when he cleans up the giant mess on the company junk desk). And that\\'s what ben does and the character was scripted as on how a matured and righteous person will react to every situation. Ben felt bad seeing matt having an affair and could not say it to her. After seeing matts affair, when in office where Jules and everyone finds out that ben is disturbed - Ben could not swallow and digest what he saw and could not spit the same out. The character of ben is a summation of maturity and all goodness that a human being should possess. Even tempered film that matches his Ben character. So I loved that she and Ben had become friends not just work colleagues. LOVED that Ben took his first date to a FUNERAL! Ben (De Niro) is a retired widower looking to fill in an empty part of his life. Eventually Ben becomes more than just the intern as the two form a friendship. Ben is a man filled with empathy and wisdom, the ideal grandpa and mentor. Much like Ben, I am a softy at heart. His portrayal of Ben whiter is what made him one of the most lovable characters in recent film. A retired man, widowed and in his 70\\'s, Ben (Robert De Niro) decides to rejoin a fashion company led by a young executive, Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway). Ben is so willing to help, you wonder where he has been all your life. Ben, a goodhearted seventy-year-old retired divorcee, teaches the youngsters in the office new tricks. You have Ben Whittaker (De Niro), a widower who just wants some higher form of human interaction. And her first impression of Ben is that he\\'s too observant not to mention a little invading. Of note: Deniro Ben whiter has a need to fill a void in his life. This is a movie of Ben \" who is a 70 years old retired \" salary-man\"and Jules who is a young entrepreneur.\" However, Ben, salaryman is great.After his retirement, he applied for some internship. I really impressed about the story line, i worked in start up company too and i know her feeling and i love ben, he so humble !

How the not so teach say senior intern Ben comes into julep\\'s life and helps her in her journey is what the film is about. Ben feels that learning more about technology and working with young people feels like just the challenge he needs to occupy his mind and his time. Ben ends up working directly for the company\\'s very capable, but over-extended founder, played by Hathawaye Hathaway. Ben is at the story\\'s center, but it\\'s the great mix of interesting characters and subplots that makes this movie so worthwhile. De Niro plays 70-ish Ben, who was once an executive at a phonebook (remember those?) The movie opens with Ben recording his application video, intercut with a montage of his present-day life, which includes a trip to San Francisco to see his son and grandchildren and, back home, an awkward exchange with a local widow - played by a very funny, if under-utilized, Linda lain (of \"Alice\" fame) - who has her own plan for how to cure Ben\\'s loneliness. Lo and behold, the company - an internet fashion retailer called \"About the Fit\" - calls Ben in, and he gets the gig. And with Ben so competent, he\\'s just the fellow to save the day. Ben even finds a more appropriate - for Meyers\\' taste - love interest in the form of the beautiful office masseuse played by Rene Russo (Nightcrawler), charming as ever, and, of course, 11 years younger than Ben (Lavin\\'s character is just too old and pushy). Ben was a positive role model on a younger generation of men.

When Ben is assigned to drive page to a kids\\' birthday, he discovers Matt kissing another woman. Ben (Robert De Niro) is a widower, and without much to do in his day, sends a video to be considered, and is chosen as an intern. The story in fact surprised me especially at the first act, because I found myself focused on Ben, wanting to see him succeed, and from the beginning it is infallible. The problem is that when the film keeps moving forward, we never see a more vulnerable or flawed side of Ben, then it ends up being perfect, something that doesn\\'t exist. They were handed a little bit in the third act, as it looks like a completely different movie from the first half-hour, where it\\'s a pleasure to see Ben\\'s relationship with the other interns who are decades younger than him and has a light tone. Sweet, sensitive, thoughtful movie - so much better than I expected A retired 70-year-old widower, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), is bored with retired life. nice pairing Ben whittler (Robert De Niro) is a 70 year old Brooklyn widower and a retired executive from the phone company. It\\'s been a hectic 18 months for the married mother of little girl and she is reluctantly forced to use Ben as her assistant. Ben befriends everyone until find starts to find him indispensable. And as the trailers would have you know, Ben will slowly but surely overcome her reservations with a keen sensitive eye and an unerring professionalism, eventually becoming not just a calming ear amidst the day to day chaos at the workplace but also an invaluable source of advice for her professional and personal woes. You may disagree – as Ben does – with whether she is being naïve, but hey it\\'s undeniably still a strong gutsy move for a woman to put aside her pride and her hurt to offer forgiveness and to choose to stay together. It isn\\'t just coincidence that the company Ben joins is in the Internet business; as incongruous as his presence may be in an industry that arguably does not appeal to his age demographic, meters wants to let the young upstart coos of today\\'s teach companies know that – as the tailing goes – experience never gets old and that there is something that the deny leaders can learn from their gene counterparts. The main protagonist is Ben, at least, that\\'s what the audience is supposed to be led to believe. Ben offered to break into the house? ), and to just make the audience accept Ben was seeing someone else and would not, under any circumstances, fall for Hathawaya Hathaway character (so the hotel room scene is not as awkward as it must he felt while writing it). Does Ben get the coo job he so OBVIOUSLY deserved? Former phone book executive Ben whittler (played by Deniro) has traveled the world and spent his retirement trying to relax and enjoy new hobbies like tax Chi. His impressive resume and video resume lands him a job for a growing commerce fashion company that\\'s in the same building that Ben had worked in for many years.

In the beginning, she has nothing for Ben to do.

He teaches them about showing respect - in one scene, one of the workers has to deliver something to Jay Z, and Ben advises him to put on a different shirt and comb his hair. Then... Robert Deniro, \"Ben.\" If only kind old Ben had flipped out at some point . I STILL HAVE THE MUSIC IN ME Ben (Robert De Niro) is 70 and retired. Ben whittler is seventy years old; don\\'t worry about remembering this figure as the film will constantly remind you like a nagging child. So \"Ben\" confronts him and the driver takes the day off (never to return). It was hilarious, touching though never unconvincing and certainly moving with the example Ben leads. Retired Ben did everything he wanted to early in his retirement, but when the freshness wore off, he was afraid to whiter away. Like Ben, it was pleasantly professional. ***\\n\\nFinal thoughts: Yes, and I\\'m sure this is true for many, Ben reminded me of my father. I am not as old as Ben, as established above, but I believe I saw 100% of where all of bends habits, words and emotions came from. Written and directed by Nancy Meyers, whose \"It\\'s Complicated\" I also admired, the film begins with a voice-over by one of the story\\'s protagonists, Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro), a 70 year old widower whose life is empty due to the loss of his wife. It\\'s no accident that Ben finds that julep\\'s new internet startup is in the same building as his old employer, a defunct phone book manufacturer. In many ways, Ben retains the \"talismans\" of his old world—his sage advice to many of the young male employees is always to keep a handkerchief in one\\'s possession at all times, as it might come in handy to comfort a weeping female who might experience an emotional upset at an inopportune time. After two days of finding herself warming up to Ben, she forgets about her earlier request to have him transferred and finds herself apologizing to Ben after her aide carries out her earlier (but no longer extant) wishes. Indeed, here it\\'s Ben discovering that julep\\'s seemingly \"perfect\" husband is having an affair with a mother of one of the children their daughter is friendly with. Likable light drama Following the death of his wife, 70-year old Ben feels a need to recover some purpose in his life, so he joins an up-and-coming internet fashion company under their mature intern program, and finds himself assigned to founder and CEO Jules Ostin. Hero Ben is a feminist from the outset because his late wife Molly was a middle school principal, i.e., a woman who combined success in family and in administration. Well, yeah, so Ben has to teach the other playground Moms the pride they should take in julep\\'s success. In business Ben unpacks his glass case, clock, calculator, pens, all superHathawayuated — before launching into the computer world. The film\\'s one weak spot is its treatment of the shorter, homelier, much more wrinkled woman who pursues Ben and gives him the finger when she sees him with Fiona. The Intern tells the story of a widower named, Ben Whittaker(Robert De Niro). Apart from being a widower, Ben is also retired. Ben seizes this golden opportunity to get back in the game.

Ben is then assigned to intern for the owner of the company, Jules Ostin, and their opposite personalities create a bond between them that helps them through their lives. To see how Ben has impacted the lives of the people around him, to bring joy to their lives. I think Ben (Robert De Niro) was a slightly strange casting call to play the retired cute guy. No matter what the movie is about it all comes down to the relationship between Ben whiter a 70 year old widower looking to keep active in order to prevent heathland Jules Ostin, a young woman who runs a successful company that Ben comes to intern for. Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn\\'t intend to give him work and it is just window dressing.\" He brings a charming blend of wisdom, humor, and vulnerability to the character, making Ben an endearing and relatable presence. I especially love how every one of the younger characters naturally gravitates to Ben (De Niro), and without him trying to convince anyone of anything, they all naturally tyr to emulate him. Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is retired and on his own and wants something to do. She is reluctant to have Ben around seeing his as being too old but Ben perseveres. I can hardly imagine a guy as smart as Ben, being team lead for years and not able to switch on a computer; and last but not least, there are never so personal discussions in a working place, constantly addressing the feelings of everyone. I was very charmed by this Ben(Robert De Niro) a 70 year old retiree, who was been a widower for three years, feels he is missing a little bit of things in life. 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker Robert De Niro) has discovered that retirement isn\\'t all it\\'s cracked up to be.

Deniro plays Ben, a retired production and marketing executive who worked in an obsolete industry and who is considered obsolete himself due to his age. Ben eventually proves himself invaluable to the company and, as the consummate team player, helps to spotlight the overlooked talents of julep\\'s assistant and three other interns. Ben comes to the rescue with an unconventional solution which leads to an amusing scene, but it means the talent she needs to learn to draw upon is taken out of the equation and we never learn how she handled the simultaneous disasters. There is a romance between Ben and the other interns. There\\'s a romantic subplot between Ben, played by De Niro (68), who is pursued by Patty (Linda lain (78)), but hooks up with Fiona (Rene runs (61)). Ben dumping the cougar for a younger woman is vaguely amusing.

I did expect him to be the in name only coo of the company, and I imagine some funny situations could have been made when Ben attempts to fool the investors that he is in charge and experienced in fashion enough to safely direct the company. Ben comes up with the bright idea to break into her mother\\'s house, intercept the computer, delete the email. In fact, in the move, Ben points out that the brooklet building she uses for her company, once housed the telephone book publishing company Ben had once been a manager in. Jules doesn\\'t need Ben--it just so happens that Ben is very helpful, very insightful, very machismo in that way that 70 year old man are machismo with self-confidence from having lived a righteous life. I wanted Ben to be named CEO--that would have been perfect and schmaltzy; the director--producer saw something different. Ben gets along with all the young guys and gals at the company. Ben is observant, sensitive and says all the right things at the right time, therefore positively influencing everyone around him. We begin by seeing Ben, played by Deniro, struggle to cope with the daily life of a retired man who is living alone in New York City. Fan idea: I hoped mule\\'s mother was the lady that follows Ben around, but Ben doesn\\'t want anything to do with. After she doesn\\'t, Ben says, \"I thought you were going to sit on the couch\".

Deniro Ben Whittaker, a widower who finds that typical retirement life doesn\\'t suit him so well, is as charming a character as the movies has ever given us. As a woman of a certain age, I appreciate the generational give and take between Ben and the youngsters at work.

Far from being a Willy Loman, desirous Ben whittler is a robust and astute entrepreneur with an infectious enthusiasm. One of the best lines in Meyers\\' script was when Ben acknowledged that he was always able to get along with everyone. Ben whittler may be a dying breed. Breathe and relax for inner balance...... 70-year-old widow Ben is bored with retired life. But Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom...... There\\'s of course the bride whose name is Rachel (Rachel Getting Married (2008)), the scene where Ben is talking to himself in the mirror (Taxi Driver (1976)) and of course my personal favorite, the airplane scene where Ben and Jules are chatting (Midnight Run (1988)). In this movie he is 70 year old Ben even though he is actually older than the role he is playing here. The contrast between the mise-en-scene, and other characters place Ben as a creature in endangerment of being extinct, a dying breed of chivalry. And it works for a simple reason, these two persons have a generational gap, obviously, you can\\'t be born four decades apart and expect to have similar views on life, and obviously Ben has a lot to teach and Jules is receptive. She has concerns, she worries about her life and she listens to Ben, and Ben doesn\\'t take any pride from it either.

This story takes place in Brooklyn, New York where we meet Ben (De Niro), a retired, mild-mHathawayered, widower who wants to keep busy and he gets a job as an intern for online fashion company, \"About The Fit.\" runs (Showtime) plays Fiona, a massage therapist who works and finds romance with Ben. basic but pleasant Seventy-year-old, Brooklyn-based widower and retiree Ben Whittaker\\'s life is an ongoing, relentless effort in creativity. The film told us the story of Ben whittler (De Niro) a widower of 70 years old and a retired man, who wants to keep his life and mind busy, he travel, he learned new languages, he takes yoga classes, he goes for walks and tried his best to make a busy life, anyway he keeps feeling like something is missing in his life, like he could do more and be more. The perspective of an older person comes from a man, the intern of the title, Ben (a charming Robert De Niro), who is widowed and lonely (fortunately the lovely Rene Russo is on hand as Fiona the company masseur). She is hiding real vulnerabilities as Ben comes into her life and slowly fills the gap left by her parents who have an uninvolved attitude. Starring as Ben - a widower who is just withering away with inactivity and boredom who decides to go back to work - desire shows he \"still has it\". His Ben is a strong character, as nuanced as one can be in this type of film and...yes...EXTREMELY charming. One, the scene in which Ben first meets his love interest at work is a little juvenile in my opinion. I think the only purpose it serves was to illustrate that Ben could relate to his younger counterparts regarding a universal topic. I also thought the scene where the younger interns and Ben went to the mother\\'s house seemed out of character for Ben. Ben is wearing the conventional suit and tie in the video, and is clean shaven. Like Ben\\'s age of 70, his appearance is in stark contrast the rest of the men at the business, who are in their 20s and 30s, and donning hoodies, thick-rimmed glasses and facial scruff. Ben also has a more masculine demeanor than those of the millennial generation. One day at work, Ben is staring out the window of what used to be his old office, before the business space was renovated and became Jules\\' production floor. Ben goes outside to calmly let the driver know what he knows, and offers to take over as Jules\\' driver. Ben becomes Jules\\' confidante, offering guidance, support, and a unique perspective rooted in his own life experiences. In the scene of Ben admonishing Matt, That was amazing because he did that without mentioning his affair. Deniro stars a Ben, a 70 year old widower who wants a job to add something dependable to his life. Ben worked for a telephone book company for 40 years, and he misses that regular rhythm of life. She finally starts noticing Ben, who gets hired as an intern to connect with older folks, and Ben has a lot to offer because of his strong experience. Ben can relate to everyone, young, middle, older aged folks. Ben is an alcoholic? Although the character was very little, but still, trying to make Ben and find a pair was kind of making the story go off track. Ben goes for it but learns he must submit a \"video resume\" as part of the interview process, which naturally sounds bizarre to his traditional ears. Ironically, \"About the fit\\'s offices are located in the same brick warehouse building that Ben used to be CEO. Can \"old-fashioned\" Ben, whose most technologically advanced gizmo is a tiny Samsung phone, get \"with it\" and carve out a niche in this growing company? Despite a few expected faltering starts in using the new equipment and getting along with much younger co-workers like frantic lives- with-his-parents geek Davis (Zach Pearlman), tech-savvy Jason (Adam De Vine), and polite Cameron (Andrew RHathawayells), bends experience and professional, wise demeanor soon gain their trust and respect and help him advance. and really doesn\\'t want to deal with Ben (nothing personal) and even tries to get him relocated to another department. Can Ben point her in the right direction? Ben Whittaker, played by Robert De Niro, is a 70 year old widower who is trying to get back into the present world. I also love the approach given where Ben is portrayed as a very humble worker who understands his position as an Intern, despite of his 40 years of working experience. A subtle blend of the old with the new..., old school Ben (De Niro) comes into an informal modern and overly trendy e-commerce business wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase, whilst his co-workers are young and hip and haven\\'t got an ounce of self-respect between them; just as Ben tries to fit into their world, the new world..., he helps his co- workers learn about themselves, learn some self-respect, and that the old ways are sometimes the best ways. From the beginning of the movie, Ben whittler stood out like an odd duck among his new, much younger, \"hipper\" peers. Despite not being given much to do, Ben was determined to be productive and soon enough those he worked with were charmed by his wizened, gentle, and reliable character. Ben even ended up in an unlikely friendship with his younger, driven, workaholic boss, Jules. Over the course of working there, Ben becomes popular with his fellow, mostly younger, co-workers, including his boss and the founder of the company, Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway). Ben-such a cute and lovable character. I overlooked that Ben was perfect. This film could have gone down the clicked route of Deniro character Ben messing up because he isn\\'t aware of the latest technologies or business practices of a startup run by a millennial. Synopsis: 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker has discovered that retirement isn\\'t all it\\'s cracked up to be. Ben Whittaker, a 70 year old retired widower is looking for a way to give more meaning to his empty and unproductive live. Robert desire plays Ben a 70-year-old retiree, struggling to enjoy his days alone. desire is spoon as his Ben keeps one foot on the floor with a priceless expression on his face. Ben is a gentleman, his grooming is sophisticated and attitude for tune is more than her expectation. The movie begins with a 70-year-old widower named Ben Whittaker, played by Oscar Robert Deniro, who is fed up with his retirement and longs for a goal/purpose in life. Its the story of Ben, a 70-year old retired person who denies the concept of being retired, trying to explore the new world, joining as an intern in an E-Commerce Start Up. Ben, a widower who is retired, see a flier while getting some groceries about a senior intern program at a start-up. Ben is assigned to work with Jules, CEO, who is somewhat skeptical at first. Initially frozen out by her, Ben slowly wins over coworkers with his likability and gets into julep\\'s good graces. And Ben having seen all, done all-becomes bored. And for Ben\\'s case, it is even more understandable given that his wife is dead-making room for lone times. Three-quarters of the film features Robert de Niro\\'s character Ben serving as a guidance counselor to Hathawaye Hathaway\\'s-in few cases saviour. Old fashioned man After I finished watching this movie, I immediately want to make friends with Ben. Ben is gentle and intelligent. But, all Ben was doing was showing you the dignity of labor and how you could totally connect to people two generations after you by just being calm and helpful. It is about how small things in our everyday life could be fixed with good attitude and good humor and Ben personifies the guy who doesn\\'t take offense at anything, loves his work (which is why he returns as an intern to a company now running in a remodelled version of his old workplace - a nice touch to the story). Ben is a great guy who tries to look like the guy next door and it helps that he teaches mHathawayerisms like carrying a handkerchief on you so you could offer it when some lady is crying. This is a movie encircling about a retired 70 year old widower,Ben played by Robert De Niro. More fantastic than Harry Potter I have grown up with a toxic father so Ben is a more fantastic character for me than Harry Potter. People would eat Ben alive. For one, I really really wish Ben whittler wasn\\'t a flawless star. Not just Ben, every one in the movie is sweet, nice, and harmless to the point of being cloying. You\\'ve got a guy like Ben that is supposed to be all proper, dresses well, speaks well, has an immaculate house, and has the proper answer for everything is all of the sudden breaking into mom\\'s house with a bunch of unlikable zit- faced kids. I mean the things Ben said, how he dealt with everything was just a phenomenal example to us on how to handle certain situation. I felt that if family Post had a brother, it would be Ben Whittaker. Ben Whittaker (Robert Di Niro) a 70-year-old widower, applies for a senior internship in an exuberant online fashion retail company held by a very assiduous micro-manger Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway).The movie has nothing new to showcase, it\\'s just like meters previous flicks but with a tint of cross-generation element. What I loved about this movie: - the actuality of it - I felt for Ben when he was trying to open up the Mac for the first time... Ben used to work in the same building for several dozen if years, until he retired - they used to do phone books there. There is a scene I really love when Ben explains why men carry around with themselves handkerchiefs. - the difference between men and boys - or the difference between Ben and all his other colleges that have no clue what style is, even though they work in the fashion online environment. Those are some of the things that Ben teaches them ;) even Jules asks the question that for a long while was in my mind as well: \"where are the men now-days?\" Ben came across as being used by the younger generation in the movie. Robert De Niro plays Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old widower, who decides that he\\'s had enough of the lifestyle of a retiree, and opts to refresh his career when he comes across an opportunity to work as a senior citizen in a growing online fashion startup. Ben Whittaker, our perfect gentleman, saying the right things, doing the right things, in his just year, does inspire a lot; but sometimes too idealistic for my taste. Ben is a window and retired man, and at the age of \\'65\\', he applied for a job in this modern world Where people are working on laptops. The two of them get encountered as Ben becomes julep\\'s personal intern. Subsequently, Ben becomes her right hand who is responsible for each aspect of her life, starting from getting her daughter to and from school, to breaking into her mother\\'s house to delete an email sent to her by mistake from Jules. However, the journey for Ben, the leading role wasn\\'t much of a struggle. Ben is a character whom we all want to be in our real life , A loved one who knows what to say and do in the right spot. Ben has nothing to prove and is secure but obviously lonely and feels isolated ,even though he does have some unwanted attention..De Niro sets a nice tone with his well proved facial expressions and gradually becomes liked by his colleagues_x0085_.the first few scenes convey the uncertainty of the young staff with an older person present_x0085_.i think there is a message in this re culture and our need to keep moving on, forgetting the benefits of experience and old age ,doesn\\'t just mean drooling and demise . The relationships Ben has with his colleagues is touching and meaningful ,leading to the advice that would otherwise be unavailable and the young staffs reliance on media for conversation and communication is challenged ! I really admire the Ben whittler character. You instantly begin to form a bond with Ben (Robert De Niro) which seems to only get stronger as the film progresses. Ben finds a vacancy in online-store of women\\'s clothes. We\\'re introduced with a retired man, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), who\\'s not actually lose interest in life, even after becoming a widower. One day, Ben seizes the senior fellowship opportunity in trendy fashion agency. This is tough obstacle, but not for Ben. Ben, ex up of phone book printing agency, has a great experience in business, and all his efforts happens to be extremely valuable in the fashion office, where everybody is in a hurry. Ben easily makes a rounds with his new coworkers and show his sensitivity and desire to cooperate with anybody who needs the help. You can see how julep\\'s approach to people changes under the influence of contact with Ben. \", but in response, Ben only smiles. Ben was the man, who rescued Jules\\' life from two very dangerous decisions, so sometimes very unexpected things (such as an internship for elder) gives the opportunities, one has never dreamed of. Ben helped her to recover from adversity, to save her position and family. And the younger intern who lives with Ben. The main consistency is the sweetness of Ben, and his relationships and influence on people. But it is Ben who is initially turned on by her, which she follows through perhaps realizing older people do get more muscular twinges and provides relaxation treatment for him (he does also have an age related heart condition). Finally my curiosity about Robert De Niro performance as a retired 70-year-old widower named Ben won with me and I started watching. Second minute of the movie hit with a phrase spoken by Ben - \"I realized the key to this whole deal was to keep moving. I loved how Ben try to learn about the new model of companies. Ben despite being from the old generation supports the idea of working woman and is a sorted person who offers helping hand to everybody. In reality, the plot has no real structure; it has a beginning: Ben is hired, but the middle appeared to consist of minimal conflicts, and the end was as satisfying as, well, most movies nowadays. This movie made me cry and dwell deeper and look at my 30-something life thru the eyes of a career-driven, millennial like Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway); yet it also made me ponder on what lies ahead and what I would ever want to achieve thru Ben\\'s life (Robert Deniro. I really liked the way Robert De Niro played the elderly Ben who is trying to find his way back into life with a senior internship with to successful e-commerce entrepreneur Jules, played by Hathawaye Hathaway. In this film Ben is used to portray the old man who is out of touch with the modern world. Ben makes an effort to do all these small things, such as driving her to and from work, which add up to help warm his way into julep\\'s heart. Ben whittler goes against most stereotypes because he is a retired man who knows nothing about computers, however, he is still able to make it in the company. Working completely online is initially a challenge for Ben, someone who worked for a phonebook company for forty years. On top of the technology struggles, Ben is placed to work directly alongside the founder of the company Jules Ostin, played by Hathawaye Hathaway. From the beginning, Ben is warned this task is going to be a tough one but despite the difficulty of the task, he uses his intellectual wit and charm to impeccably fill the role. Ben Whittaker, a seventy-year-old man who is struggling to find meaning in his life. Nobody takes the time to get to know her accept for Ben.',\n",
       " 'review_cluster_7': 'I can\\'t believe what other critics are rating and saying about this movie. A gentle film with low stakes and surface level lessons/values. For the most part, this movie delivered. This is a terrible movie with an awful message. Special Effects: 1,0/Sound Effects: 1,0/Acting: 1,0/Story: 2,0 Why whyyy is this movie not rated above 90%? Seemed film was more interested in creating a statement than making it an enjoyable film. This movie is for those that don\\'t take life to seriously and are just laid back. My therapist metros like film it\\'s too dark knight esque. What the film does, is instil those good old values and attributes in a modern digital world, mixed into the emotions of old school gentleman. So obviously I was sure the movie was to be great. The point is, with this film, in watching the plot unfold. Very lame movie and the acting was forced in most scenes. ism surprised the critics gave this one such poor ratings. Makes me wonder if they ever know how to enjoy a good movie. I used to watch movies based on critic\\'s ratings but now I know better. Movie is to reflect a work place that never in a thousand years would exist. this isn\\'t a bad movie, its just not interesting or memorable. They could do those scenes without even talk. By no means, the film gets boring but you feel that there is not much substance here. In the second half of the film he lands in dangerous territories proposing an idea of forced background with inconsistent narrative implications. It\\'s not classic cinema, but it also wasn\\'t meant to be. I don\\'t really know what the movie was trying to teach me. Personally, could have done with out that part of the movie but critics already said this movie wasn\\'t edgy enough... Everything unfolds in areas almost white phones of the golden age of Hollywood. I find it hard to say anything negative about this film. of movie, De hero sucked in this movie. The movie earns one star for being outstandingly bland, to the point that it would be fair to call this the cinematic equivalent of a pack of white smart dress shirts... watched using boxxy software yesterday. - you keep wishing that they could find each other in a better movie. The movie is as bland and superfluous as it gets. To that point, the movie had no real dramatic tensions . A dramatic situation develops that actually seems to give the movie some dramatic weight. That movie had truth and human interest. Also, don\\'t think too hard about this movie, there are Plot Holes. The movie has some problems with it\\'s plot especially with the family/husband storyline. The vibe of the film was reminiscent of similarly-themed is and is films, but I haven\\'t really seen anything like this in almost 20 years. They just don\\'t make these kind of movies anymore. The movie tries too hard to be progressive. Also the movie feels kind of like a giant Apple advertisement, but maybe that\\'s just me. It is nice to see that among the trash is a movie deserving of his talents and worth your time. I can see where some people would not like this movie at all. GREG: Actually, Scott, I found this movie somewhat patronizing. Fortunately, the images of the actor are naturally melting into the film, they are helpful to make the movie brightening. Events of outside of the company are increasing rather than outside of the company, and even an event that is kind of offence, is added for a tension of the movie. The film is a bit predictable and vanilla but has a lot of hart. As the film progresses, meters slowly drifts the focus away from bends impact on About The Fit, to focus on the founder\\'s life. We painfully see how the movie degenerates into a rant about feminism, relationships, success, manhood and well, so many disperse things that it resembles more to a am tumble post than an list studio production. But my final analysis of this film is that it could NEVER happen in reality. Superb - how films should be. Still, the film is so gentle and charming my critical impulses were mostly disarmed for the film\\'s running time. Bonus points to meters for including enough sort-of allusions to Taxi Driver (De Niro practising phrases in the mirror, De Niro driving people around) that the film can almost be read as a kind of subversive anti-Taxi Driver in which the subject is not violence and alienation but kindness and simple human connection. Oh, and add me to the chorus of people pleased that the film is, for a Hollywood picture, relatively age-appropriate in its approach to romance (Rene Russo is still substantially younger than De Niro, but at least he\\'s not dating someone half his age). It\\'s one of those movies that feels like it was written 15 years before it was made, then \\'updated\\' just before cameras rolled. I saw this movie on store shelves, but had some doubts about it. The film did try \"to be cool\" but its sincere approach to the world of startups should be commended, especially given its very progressive but not too provocative touch on feminism and the conflict between career and family. Many things about this film can be considered unrealistic, including its heartwarming ending, but unrealistic optimism is sometimes still in need, especially in such \"dark\" worlds of young entrepreneurs and old \"retirees\". A film different from the others, the plot promised, was expected. This movie relied on its two stars. Women can relate to this movie, especially women with a purpose. Really didn\\'t, want to watch this movie because he was so far removed from this genre. Easily the film\\'s most ridiculous moment, but it didn\\'t outstay it\\'s welcome and serves as an effective palate cleanser in the middle of the movie. 8/31/16 I actually disliked watching this film. Then, about half way through the film, it becomes much darker, and quite frankly, just depressing. I am not one to watch these types of movies. There are a few examples of that but the movie is far more than a story about generational differences. This is not one of those roles or movies. I have liked her other films, but this is a lot different from them. I mean it was well written screenplay with much better understood the contemporary world than just focusing on the relationships as usual. You are going to agree with me that the film\\'s posters or the trailers were not very impressive as what the actual film did to grab our full attention. The two hours films are always a concern to me, but when a film like this runs for that long, I can even sit for another half an hour. I thought this movie was going to be bad, but it was not. However, towards the end of the movie it does get kind of boring. It was just a bit bland, and I don\\'t think it added much to the movie! Not bad for what is a somewhat typical \\'fish out of water\\' trope & chick flick: this is one movie that does it really well. I put it on in the background one night after The Ringer\\'s and greenwood mentioned it as a solid \"Plane Movie\" and ism glad I did. Certainly doesn\\'t take any risks or cover new territory, but like most other Nancy Meyers movies, if it comes on I will watch it all the way through. You get to see desirous lighter side in this movie. Along the way, the movie addresses topics like older values versus newer values, differences between generations, and how to have a useful attitude and be effective even when others are doubting you. The movie should have been called Lean On Me, because the movie was more about the day in the life of a CEO. Right from the start you can tell the film will have a lot of heart and it does in truckloads. Had potential but the unrealistic stupid crap that they wrote into the script ruins any chance this movie had to be good. The film was able to capture the new Brooklyn landscape without letting the Hipsterfication of neighborhoods like Park Slope get in the way of telling this odd-couple story. This movie is more than that. My criticisms of this movie are some of the characters are too perfect, some actors are underutilized, and some of the plot points are a tad clichÃ©. I understand what the movie was TRYING to do, but boy did it fail. Wasn\\'t the WORST movie have seen lately. A nice, quiet film that doesn\\'t need much of an attention span to follow its cloche story-line. It\\'s like they just went through the motions when creating this film. I had low expectations for this film. But, there are lots of meaningful moments and the movie is entertaining. Where this film falters, is the choices made by some of the characters in the final act. I did not believe that this particular conclusion would have happened in reality, and while the film played out as a very realistic picture, that shift in tone was jarring to me. Having wanted to see this movie last year but being unable to due to a busy schedule at the time. ism currently disappointed as I wasn\\'t able to make the time to see this movie sooner. Overall this movie is not without its flaws. Movie went above expectations. more movies should bring this level of acting, humor and still be family friendly. ism not sure what this movie was trying to achieve. I suppose more than anything it could be classified as an emotion film, but it goes about evoking it in the wrong way. What I didn\\'t enjoy about this movie was the over the top scenes that were just notably devoid of the proper emotional content. It was watching an actor trying to cry really really hard, and I couldn\\'t connect at all. A man who has been in the film industry this long deserves credit for carrying this thinly veiled attempt to make a quick buck from those of you looking for a movie to see on date night. # FilmsOn airplanes It a pleasure to watch a fun movie with one \"F\" word. It was nice not to be scared, disgusted or terrorized while watching a movie. There\\'s nothing to say about this film as it\\'s one big safe commercial more than anything thought-provoking. Better than I\\'d imagined but nothing more than a basic chick-flick I personally wouldn\\'t rent it unless you support expensive actors like nine Hathaway stealing money from all the people behind the set getting minimum wage vice versa. And it meets my expectations :) Ah but if you look carefully, this movie is quite deep, and on so many levels. By no means a bad film, though a few bits weren\\'t really needed. A film so featherlite and desperate to be liked it floats away into nothingness after fifteen minutes. In short, this film is not only entertaining, it actually offers a life lesion that we all could stand to learn. it wasn\\'t too bad of a movie but I think it played out pretty slowly and it definitely had a lesson I didn\\'t care about embedded into it. Easy to watch film, there is no pressure as it all works out in the end for the best........... There was certainly a lot of hype during the email crisis scene, thus making the film more interesting and almost forcing people to pay attention to it again if ever the problem. And that\\'s a compliment considering my personal opinion in the genre. With profound leads like desire and Hathaway, there\\'s an extra factor of quality that makes this movie plausible and enjoyable. They\\'re both likable characters, which makes the movie enjoyable until late in the film when it just completely runs out of steam, instead opting for an awful, awful message. Looking at his film library, this goes all the way back to Silver Linings Playbook, a film that he is not even a lead in. You\\'ve seen this movie before, and I promise you that you posses the ability to map this out with very little difficulty. I don\\'t think this needed to be a full 2 hours long; it could have 20 minutes shaved off easy, and it would have been a better movie for it. A fun movie, but was this produced by AARP? The film does have a lot of its moments and some fast pacing, but every time the film focuses on dresses and cosmetics, it hits rock bottom. The \"sexual inneudo\" is not necessary and did not add to the movie! Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and ism not surprised that it made such a profit. Round-Up: This movie was written and directed by Nancy Meyers, 66, who brought you the Parent Trap in 1998, the funny What Women Want, with Mel Gibson, Something\\'s Gotta Give, with the great Jack Nicholson, the Holiday and It\\'s Complicated, with Meryl Streep. She also makes original movies and introduces different elements so they\\'re not a straight lace romantic comedies. Although this movie doesn\\'t have any romance at all, the relationship between the two main characters is still quite emotional, even though they come from two completely different world\\'s. Lets be honest here...This movie is exactly how you expect it will be.. Get redo film for the weekend It has great performances all around, and very few flaws except for the slow pace that makes the movie feel longer than it needs to be. If there was a better conflict this could have been a more heartfelt film. Far better than most rom-coms and a far better feminist comedy than the tripe that was Trainwreck. for a hectic fridge night with nothing else to do this film fit the bill. It\\'s a movie which fits in the current scenario very well, about the role of women in today\\'s scenario? You\\'ll find the pace of the movie is somewhat slower than many but it has it\\'s action and humor moments. This movie could even inspire guys getting back to the era of being gentlemen. I didn\\'t get a chance to see it in the theater but it was fine to see it at home. It is possible that some moments the plot is too sweet, and dangerously approaches being a not too feminist film... bullet that manages to evade the American topic of \"family is first\" (especially if you\\'re a woman). Who says there are not still great movies being made. Probably the idiots that write most of the movie reviews on Redbox, or Rotten Tomatoes. I would put this right up there with \"Devil Wears Prada.\" I have been noticing and paying closers attention to musical scores in movies lately. I have seen some potentially good movies fall flat because of lack of music, or Too much noise. It does have scenes that do not contribute to the plot. Overall it is a fun and small film that knows exactly what it is even though it is faulty in the fact that it feels very predictable. + Yes, maximal have-it-all chick flick. Everyone needs to see this movie. Not just a chick flick. This movie was really pretty terrible, much worse than I would have guessed. There\\'s really not enough substance to keep the film interesting. This movie was horrible and couldn\\'t get more cloche I love Bobby D but this movie was beyond corny and not in a good way. Their alchemy is obvious and the film benefits greatly from it. It kept our attention with a continued interest in upcoming scenes. Probably the worst movie have ever watched. It fails to differ from other movies of its genre, and is nothing unique, special, or creative. This film is interesting since it does not follow the traditional film format, per we - but it still works. De film werd uitgebracht op 25 september 2015 door Warner Bros. --Kritische reactie: -The Intern ontving gemengde kritieken van critici. CinemaScore kondigde aan at publiek de film een gemiddelde cijfer van \"A-\" op een A+ naar F-schaal heeft. -Richard Roeper heeft de film een \"A-\", waarin \"met enige echte inzichtelijke dialoog, een aantal echt grappige stukjes fysieke business en kleine scènes waardoor ons toestaan te kennen en bevallen van een half dozijn ondersteunende spelers, The Intern great ons van scène naar scène, van moment tot moment.\" -Manohla Dargis in The New York Times schreef: de film was een zinnebeeld van Nancy Meyers\\' andere films: \"schuimig, speels, homogeen, routinematig gekmakende, doorgaans onweerstaanbare.\" -Clem Bastow, schrijvend voor The Guardian suggereert dat slechte beoordelingen van de film voornamelijk van mHathawayen komt, die de overgrote meerderheid van filmcritici vormt Goed geacteerd / vermakend Terrible film with a terribly boring storyline. I do NOT like this movie. The movie also shines a light on milennial issues: The rise of technology, women running a company, stay-at-home dads. It\\'s refreshing to see a movie where the conflict doesn\\'t come from impending doom; instead, the conflict arises from strained relationships. The movie shows that everyone needs someone in their corner--someone to talk to, someone to be their rock in life. No cuss words and no sex scenes! An example of how me being open minded with Movies can sometimes blow up right in my hairy face. The movie has kind of a sitcom premise, but manages to rise above it to be a surprisingly affecting platon-com (patent pending). The film though is a great insight into the lives of Entrepreneurs, they tend to put it more hours running their business than their employees, again regardless of a persons sex it\\'s generally the same story for a lot if not all young business upstarts. Probably best of all, is that it doesn\\'t follow a typical formula, like so many movies these days. My only real issue is that the movie isn\\'t really original. While it has a fun concept, the movie doesn\\'t try to be anything different or new. Un bon film diversissant  ã ranger en famille. This movie does not disappoint on any of those fronts and it also pulls off the rare trick of focusing on a male/female friendship that has nothing to do with sex. No closure and it\\'s a pretty good film until it abruptly fades away. It\\'s almost as if they ran out of money or didn\\'t know how to conclude the film. The trailer was misleading which Hathawayoyed me but the movie was a great movie! Pointless, plot locking, non scripted movie of dribble This movie was downright terrible. It wasn\\'t predictable like other films, they were so many scenes that i expected something might happen, but didn\\'t which is good, it made the movie unique in a way. It was also very realistic, literally almost everything they say in the film would be something we will say at work in reality, for an instance: when De Niro (who\\'s actually in his 70\\'s) said something about technology, it might take a little time for him to get used to it, that\\'s what an adult who\\'s over 55 would say. I think some time could have been shaven off at parts, but overall it was a great film. The movie is a perfect blend of \"old school\" thinking before the internet and new school creativity. Worth watching on did not worth the price of a movie ticket. This is the, for a lack of words, LAMEST movie I have seen. have added very few to my sickness until this movie. This movie has it all. What a disappointing movie. Knowing the characters and the premise, it was never going to be a serious movie about serious things. Given the premise of the movie, it\\'s shocking that this movie would struggle to even pass the bechamel test. This film had humor, empathy and was so much closer to a modern day \\'rom-com\\' than most movies are. This could have been a generic ordinary film, but all of the performances and direction make this worth seeing. A movies does not need to be of academy award quality or superhero based to be a great movie. I disagree with the critics on this one. While this will never win any awards, it\\'s a good Sunday-afternoon-on-the-sofa movie. This movie did not get dull and kept us entertained from start to finish. The movie gets worse with him... The film shows the environment of the corporate world and the coexistence of people from different generations, showing how the union of diverse skills (experience, resilience, daring and creativity) is fundamental to the success of a business. The movie refuses to overplay the underdog part which works well as it allows the creation of positive emotional scenes right from the start. Screenwriting 101 at its finest. I dare to say this movie may have missed its mark all together with an alternate selection for the lead. But...and this is a very strong but... (SPOILER ALERT) The writer missed a huge huge moment to take this movie to a whole other emotional plane of existence. And a challenge to Big Hollywood, think outside the box, for once! desire rarely makes a bad film. At first, I gave it a 3.5 stars rating, but then I got to thinking that the movie actually does a pretty shitty job of introducing a bunch of subplots and never getting them anywhere. Misogynistic themes posing as a feminist flick. Movie lacked depth, lacked enough direction, lacked diversity, lacked a proper climax, lacked a decent conclusion, lacked general morals and lacked a good enough message. This movie could have done something completely different with the premise, and while that may have had more potential for comedy, I don\\'t think that movie would have been as good. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars) · The movie preaches about having it all. My only major complaint is the anxiety of worrying that I had throughout the whole movie. Wait for this one on Netflix. meters is the glass ceiling new feminist film makers have to break past to be taken seriously. It\\'s definitely not STAR WARS, but this is definitely a must see..... So while this film is not an earth shattering moment in the history of cinema, it quietly goes about its business in a more intelligent way than most mainstream comedies (dramadies) and I appreciated that. Perhaps the silliness of certain moments in the script reaches what feels like great stretches in the aesthetic framework of the movie, these moments also constitute what are arguably necessary beats for the whole show to be dramatically effective. For her intended audience, though, the movie hits all the right emotional notes while still leaving them with bits of wisdom to chew on. The \"moral\" of the movie can certainly be complicated beyond that, but the aforementioned theme gets at the gist of the values that can be excavated from the picture. The film would lose much of the appeal if it was anyone else leading the film. Sometimes films like this shows that the same script can be used over and over again yet still feels new and enjoyable. If the film didn\\'t have such a preachy undertone, it would have been a much better film, but we should expect strong female leads and an old wise man from a Nancy Meyers project, right? It throws many good things for everyone to learn, understand and live but you will see them in the movie only if you want to. He didn\\'t advise on that topic thought out the movie. This is a movie to preserve. Nancy Meyers make he sort film war ze goed in is, wearing de just chemise been tijdloze situate make door been film die leaker onschuldig is. The writer/director has obviously too much of the LA New Age thing that she wants to translate this for the my audience. Maybe it\\'s because ism a 60 something, but myself and 3 guests thought this movie was funny, warm, sincere, emotional and very entertaining. But unlike many movies based on unusual premises, this movie quickly moves on from the quirkiness of the pair up to bring us a truly moving and interesting story. The two stars are firing on all cylinders throughout the movie. But it is a great example of a movie that is everything it could be. The Hollywood film industry is stuck in a bubble. It\\'s set in 2015, but all the tropes seem to be from some version of the 1940\\'s, except with glass walls and laptops instead of typewriters. The film industry is increasingly isolated, cut off from the rest of the world --- I suppose it\\'s always been that way, but there\\'s something really lazy about the insularity of it, particularly in a rapidly changing world. Too many critics in their it\\'s don\\'t quite get it! This movie makes the grade of above average completely because of the acting. I don\\'t really look at movies very analytically, so it\\'ll just stick to what it did for me. This film has a more realistic today\\'s generation family business story which actually hits home in my life. This film does have it\\'s usual styling or theme as all other films within this genre/classification though it does have a nice spark to make it stand out from many. The critics can suck it...SS It is the chemistry between the two main stars that keeps this film together. Worth watching for that alone and well the usual elements and events in films of this nature come around. It feels predominantly like an old-folks\\' flick (i.e. There was a line of the movie that stuck with me and rings true. During the film it felt like I had a inside look at their lives. Good movie, But I don\\'t understand why Hollywood always has to stick in a theme about adultery! Transposition is a tricky ingredient in the recipe for cinematic success, and it only works a small percentage of the time. This is what i would call a perfect movie, it was not over done and it did not use any clinches i could see. I would see it again and i think we need to own this movie. More of a chick flick than it\\'d anticipated. the movie kind of just stopped. ClichÃ (C), mais un trÃ¨s bon film malgrÃ (C) tout! There are a few scenes in the movie that could be cut to make it a little faster paced. However, there was one specific part in the movie that I couldn\\'t stop thinking about. this is a movie that people should see. There are a bunch of little things I have issues with in this movie. Even with all these little issues it is a funny movie and very touching. Overall a good movie, just a lot of flaws. Critics sometimes miss the point of a film. Sometimes a movie doesn\\'t need to be deep and complex. It\\'s somehow more \"honest\" than other similar films. Pretty good for they type of movie that it is. I was debating whether to give this a 3.5 star rating but when I looked back on that scene, I knew I had to give it a 4 star. Moms--bring your teen aged sons to this film! In the end, it\\'s a Nancy Meyers film... she has a certain style and it\\'s probably not going to change. It\\'s a good movie as a rental but I wouldn\\'t see it in the theater The critics are terrible at ratings. This was a solid film to escape into. This film made me borderline homicidal. Going to movies is like watching our dreams come true.... This type of progressive character is need more in film. They both help better each other over the course of the movie and do it in a way which seems natural and unforced. You didn\\'t want to miss anything, just like in an action film. I don\\'t know how many \"takes\" there were, but I can\\'t picture anyone being able to stop, start over, stop, start over, when it came to nailing this scene. Worst movie have seen in a long time. Waaaaaaay too long for the type of movie. Nancy Meyers is one of the only filmmakers whose movies I let slide when they are clicked and overwrought. *SPOILER* On the contrast, much of the movie lacked any real plot that meets the casting. As good as I hoped it would be, Nancy Meyers movies are never bad. Her next film, It\\'s Complicated, featured a great performance from beryl street (well, that\\'s expected) but an over the top ale balding and a series of terrible supporting characters ruined the film. I thought the movie would be a great look at how the wisdom of our elders can be a valuable tool in the modern workplace, but he doesn\\'t provide as much guidance as I was expecting. Unusually lengthy movie. meter\\'s film would have worked better if he had shot someone. Lovable film #chickflick The story is always moving forward, which doesn\\'t always happen with movies in this genre. A good picture to take your parents to, unless your parents have good taste in movies. This movie has funny aspects throughout the two hours, however there\\'s no story to follow and therefore you don\\'t have any attachment to a character which becomes boring after half an hour. He puts this movie on his shoulders and runs to daylight, milking the best of scenes with expression and nuance. It\\'s not often I get the kind of emotional truth in a movie where I feel like I should leave the room because ism intruding on the characters, but I felt that way in this movie. Only wish the \"heist\" scene wasn\\'t in the film. We need more of these type of movies. YAWN --- so little substance in this trite bland movie. Cute,one of those frustrating movies whereby the trailer, which shows it to be this fun romp - is not exactly true. Nancy, oh Nancy, there was one of your movies, I mean, that I didn\\'t like. This was a movie I probably wouldn\\'t have seen and I KNOW my husband wouldn\\'t have seen it - he didn\\'t say anything, but I knew and he said as much afterwards. A bit like \\'The Devil Wears Prada\\' but a bit more nice. I would give it a 4 but, there was something a bit slow in this film, I just didn\\'t feel there was a climax to the story, the middle and then denouement and just yey. Great film of the times though: what with stay at home dad and the whole start up company and all. This is a harmless movie. I think the critics were a little tough on this movie. Worst movie ever. There was a noisy bunch behind my seat and halfway through the movie I stopped feeling my seat be kicked and turned around and saw... HALF THE FUCKING THEATRE GONE. that HOW shut THIS BORING as MOVIE IS. How can one market in cinema when they call A FUCKING DOCUMENTARY ON OLD PEOPLE A COMEDY. Maybe if Hollywood quit shoving the concept.down our throats people would stop believing women have to make choices that men don\\'t. You critics expect too much. The Intern pourrait être un film dune bruise hallucinante avec ses personages unidimensionnels (De Niro est gentil, Hathaway est stressée...) mais le scenario do film refuse tellement tout forme de cynisme quail est impossible de ne pas y trouver une forte motion deviant better history simple d\\'amitié platonique entre un homme âgé quit cherche à se renter à nouveau utile et une jejune workaholic. Chick flick? it\\'d actually put it in the category of chick flicks guys can like too. The whole movie is showing role reversals in 2015 and does a really good job of avoiding cliches. A+ all Emotions in one film. Tres bon film a regarder avec tendre moitÃ©e! I had zero problems with this movie. The only reason my sister and I went to see this movie was because Martian was full. The cinematic equivalent of a night in with friends with wine. Except in What women want cause fuck that movie. What I enjoy, when films can do it right, is when there\\'s no \"villain.\" However, the movie takes a turn from hey this old guy is working in a workplace that he\\'s not used to, to old guy and young business owner having a relationship that you aren\\'t sure where it\\'s going. Movies that you know what is going to happen, and what is going to be said but take forever in saying that can be frustrating and that\\'s a little of what is happening here. It\\'s not a good movie... and yet I had to give it a positive ranking because the characterization and conclusions the film makes are inherently different than films of this type. It had me thinking about the conversations and themes and what exactly the film was saying.... and that\\'s better than most films of this genre. The films deftly plays with inter-generational differences in work and family relationships, while showing how each generation benefits each other. Went cinema to watch this. As Nancy Meyers films go it\\'s not as bad as The Holiday but not as good as Something\\'s Gotta Give. But I hate this movie! Middling to fair, with solid, amicable performances but, when you stop to think about it, a thoroughly unnecessary film. A slapstick breaking scene in the middle is entirely out of place and does not contribute to the movie. Interesting premise that developed well throughout the movie. A little longer than required but a nice enough, inoffensive film :) It recycles familiar stereotypes and clinches that you\\'d expect from a movie of this genre, meaning the little personality the film has all comes from its admittedly damn solid cast. Because they are good actors, the films are typically better than average, they are professionally made and for better or worse hit the spot without making you think or making you more stupid. I don\\'t know if anyone should skip work to watch this movie, if you have a date or want to have a good time, just go. The strongest aspect of this film is the reality of it. And when you believe that the premise behind the movie becomes the clear focus and provides great insight to society while telling an engaging story. However, there\\'s a potential for a part 2 movie or a to series. Is it going to be the best film of all time? And that\\'s what really sells the movie in my opinion. Really, I had fun and that\\'s all that really matters for a film like this. Another new little gem from director Nancy Meyers who has successfully made a modern buddy film with the most unlikely of characters. Rarely does Hollywood actually makes movies like this anymore without sex scenes and vulgarity. This movie confirmed my opinion that critics see too many movies for different reasons than the rest of us. People like it a lot more than critics do. It\\'s really not much of a movie. A movie so devoid of conflict (an email must be deleted! The film\\'s efforts to tell a unique story fall flat. The major conflict in the film comes down to control and self actualization. For a movie, it\\'s not terribly compelling. ism surprised the film turned out as entertaining as it did. I haven\\'t seen a film this white since \\'Boyhood.\\' But there is no reason to see it in the theater. Despite desirous best efforts this movie is a bore fest . Altogether a film that really works, it\\'ll never be a Shawshank or a Ben Hur, but will stand on its own as a movie for the time and place it\\'s set, when commerce and online shopping are either done via some other medium or has disappeared altogether. Academy award winner, not. The movie was fairly long... about two hours but it was never boring. it\\'ll give this movie a 4 out 5. I can\\'t remember the last time I walked out of a theater with a feeling of hope regarding what can be very mundane \"every day life\". The whole theater was buzzing with optimism. Some of the acting was lacking in many respects, but that\\'s okay with this kind of film. A unique variation on the typical \"chick flick\" arc. This movie is much more than it appears to me. I thought it needed about 5 more minutes at the end to wrap things up in a better and tighter bow, but all in all I recommend this movie highly and would definitely see it again! You stagger out of the theater with a sense of giddiness. Then you say to yourself, \"wow, that\\'s a real film\". Now in all honesty, I don\\'t ever cry at the movies. You could also include the notion of two protagonists sharing scenes and being worlds apart in age (remember mean Reeves and dine reason in Something\\'s Gotta Give?). Yeah it ends with a level of uncertainty (talking about cinema makes way for interpretation you know). There\\'s something deeper than what was advertised in the trailer. Both films start off similar yet the latter ascends to something much greater. Be a gentleman and take a hanky, as the lady of your life will need it and it will go well after the film. While the film is a glimpse into 90s Hollywood in modern cinema - and some of the good that came with it - it also shows that the cinematic language has evolved but Myers didn\\'t. This movie is simple but it\\'s effective in everything it tries to do, and may even have an underlying message about how we see women is the work place and in society. This is not the typical movie in which I would elect to see normally. It is somewhat methodical, but the actors engage you to pull you into the movie. Chick flick. Can a movie be too nice? Lucky for me, I like these kinds of films, but for those who don\\'t, the sap may be too much. A movie that is hard to dislike. Don\\'t listen to the Rotten Tomatoes the critics have it. To bad there are not more movies like this. This film comes across as just a movie to fill a slot during a slow weekend where no prominent films that people take seriously were debuting. A Nancy Meyers film has no place for gritty realism so with that in mind, this is a safe and nice film that\\'s slightly overlong, oftentimes sitcom and does exactly what it says on the tin. The plot is thin, but the movie is charming. This movie proves that you don\\'t need things blowing up all the time or people hopping in and out of bed to make a likeable movie. A lesson to be learned when watching this movie. I have only one idea why the critics pHathawayed it. That seems reason enough for critics to hate it. it\\'ll buy it on blurry to be that pick me up movie when ism down This is very low key, entertaining, a little formula but director Nancy dyers can do this kind of movie in her sleep. Cheesy and predictable ...not worth seeing in the theater. This movie has been promoted as a comedy but its really little more that a \\'chick flick\\' designed to propagate the idea that \\'you can have it all\\'. The professional critics need to recognize that not every movie has to be a stretch. Worst movie have payed in 2015 This film is watchable, but I wasn\\'t sold on the whole sewage generation gap thing. I thought the film was also fleeting and absent a decent score and some interesting dialogue, this film is thoroughly forgettable. This is a film meant for simple viewing without any deeper meaning --------------------------------------------------------------- C+ Mostly seeing this film reminded me of the character De Niro played in \"Once Upon A Time In America\", The 70 year old De Niro looks very look the aged gangster Noodles Aaronson . Notice that those successful flicks listed in the last sentence don\\'t require much suspension of disbelief for buying the actor outside of his usual tough guy wheelhouse. The script was poorly written and the first half of the movie was up its own a$$ with happiness. Refreshing movie. The trailer for this film made it look like a cliché ridden formulaic effort that would fall flat. However, having seen the movie, I found myself presently surprised. It helps that the film maintains a light and breezy tone, moves quick from scene to scene and is filled with hilarious one liners. Between attractive & wealthy white people, beautiful sets, and a mid-movie problem that ends up working out, this movie is everything you expect and maybe even more. This movies drags, is depressing, slow, etc. have just walked out of the theater. Rather enjoyed the movie even though it ran slightly long. Go see this movie. I got to think but all y\\'all critics that giving 57% bad rotten. Now a day, yes some movies are a waste of spending money to make and can\\'t even get it right. Yes Hollywood has spent million on movies and made them pointless or a waste. but some of this Writer or Director still have the classic thoughts about how to make the movie right. Some of these are not worth for nomination, like golden Globe or scars but to give the audience, a laughter to enjoy the moment, but all these Critics all the hey think about is if the Movie is worth a nomination or not, always thinking with that mind, never of \"let me get my head out of my ass and just enjoy it at least.\" Uneven film with some nice scenes and likeable characters, especially in small roles. But some scenes just don\\'t work. Yes, you could say at times the movie stretches its believability, esp. Don\\'t believe the critics. This movie covered so many modern-day issues and did it seamlessly; (some but not all) re-entering the work force, accessing technology, and most important, stereotypes and the struggle women in the work force still continue to receive and deal with on a day-to-day basis. I rated this move 3 1/2 for two reasons: the way older women are depicted (as \"raging bitches\"--Jules Mom--\\\\ complete buffoons--the intern who couldn\\'t drive--or the pushy, lonely one-night stand--Linda Lavin\\'s character). This film is refreshing in that it recognizes that concentrating on work over family is not a mortal sin and any problems with spouse and child cHathawayot to blamed on the Type A personality in the family regardless of gender. This was somewhat of an incomplete film.. It wasn\\'t completely shown in the trailer as I originally suspected, but most of it was there. But other will see this as another New York movie. At the end of the film a portion of the audience clamped with approval. It seemed like the director left a significant number of scenes on the cutting room floor towards the end to cut the length of the movie. It deserves a higher rating than the 56% on Rotten Tomatoes. All working moms who are working to have it all should see this movie! This is probably the third best Nancy dyers movie have seen (Behind \"It\\'s Complicated\" and \"Something\\'s Gotta Give\"). Goodness reading a few of these reviews I have to wonder why some people can\\'t just go see a movie without critiquing everything from wife to pajamas showing or not showing to the scene at the moms house. You go to the movies for escapism. Everyone in the theatre seemed as if they were reacting to what was on screening. have worked for a couple of teach companies and this movie hits that nail on the head. I think this film isn\\'t bad as you assumed ! It\\'s no wonder the critics didn\\'t like it. De Niro can still carry a movie. Here\\'s a movie you want to see if you need to believe in tooth fairies and unicorns. If this movie makes any statements, the key takeaway is that being pathetic gets you ahead in life. I liked being able to sit through a movie without the crap that tries to substitute itself for decent writing these days. They should just start naming these kinds movies \"White People Problems \". The lack of people of color in this movie is only half the problem. This movie is not based in any reality. If the movie doesn\\'t have violence or sex or some kind of a crazy situation they\\'re just not happy. Most of the film was made in brooklet showing the New York borough as green and sparkling and having an empty parking spot for any in the cast of the film. -- So in words it\\'s a must see movie.\" After making crappy movies, he follows it up with this crap! Sometimes you don\\'t need a film to try and change the world, make bold political or societal statements or even be shocking. However, that\\'s one of the major factor that made me like this movie. It does its job, most movies fail to do so; maybe not a \\'great\\' movie, but a good one. A flat out bad movie. For years now (in films like\\xa0\"What Women Want,\"\\xa0\"The Holiday\" and\\xa0\"It\\'s Complicated\"),\\xa0you have been writing and directing films that put women front and center - professional women, with impressive credentials\\xa0- only to undermine the power of that image\\xa0with a strange brand of (unintentional?) On the surface, your films look, at first,\\xa0like\\xa0feminist confections, but then you always end up\\xa0trafficking in the worst kind of feminine stereotypes. If the film were 30 minutes shorter and with all of the\\xa0exposition cut out - Ben to Jules, \"You can do it on your own\" - it might be more watchable and I might forgive it its faults in the breezy rush to the finish line. meters is one of the director\\'s that every time she releases a film ism always super excited to check it out because it could become a Nancy Meyers classic like the films listed above. There\\'s something so great about seeing a film that has a strong female lead and showcases female empowerment in such an honest and relatable way. Even though the film veers off its familiar but enjoyable path from time-to-time, and I\\'m sorry Workaholics fans but Anders Holm was so miscast and delivered the worst performance I\\'ve probably seen all year. Just don\\'t pay too much for it and expect a Nancy Meyers classic and you\\'ll be film. Now, about that emphasis: two elements of this film made me cringe, and ism not talking about the occasional joke that didn\\'t work for me. The films screenplay leaves lot to be desired in terms of climax, not getting to know characters of the film totally. But what makes you sit and watch is the sweetness of the film. If you saw the trailer, you should have known what you were in for. Like it was said the main if not the only benefit of the film is its two leads. Yes, it may hit your over the head with its specific message a few times in the movie, but the rest of the movie makes up for it. It\\'s a safe choice when looking for entertaining cinema. With films such as suffragettes and the last Hunger Games coming out, we need more movies about powerful women. Nice break from the big budget blockbusters but no less entertaining. When I first saw the trailer for this one, was not quite interested, because of the way it was presented. If they weren\\'t in this movie, I wouldn\\'t have liked this movie as much. Overall, this is a lightweight film with two great leads. The stop - and - go pacing of the film may be a turn off to some, but if you can get past that, it is well worth a look. Needless to say, the level of predictability, the lack of any climax in the story development and the completely unrealistic depiction of what the postmodern startup corporate world is, damage the movie\\'s chances to be taken seriously. It may not get the big box office bucks because most prefer action movies these days, but it\\'s a fantastic movie. When you want a job done correctly, hire a pro---and I don\\'t just mean in the movie. Strangely, the movie feels like it would be a dime-a-dozen romantic comedy if the two characters were closer in age. But this is just one way that this film feels fresh as the plot, characters, and situations don\\'t feel overly forced. But the movie is not simply another attempt to push as many jokes as possible into 2 hours. There is very little to feel unsatisfied about with the film. But other than a few trite criticisms, almost any demographic will come away from this feel good movie smiling. You would not be disappointed in going to the theater to watch it. Problems with this movie are that there are many subplots like Hathaway with her family that you don\\'t care about and other subplots that are completed and are pointless to the main story of this movie. This has been the pattern with \"What Women Want (Mel Gibson, been Hunt),\" Something\\'s Gotta Give (Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson),\" \"It\\'s Complicated (Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin),\" and now \"The Intern (Robert De Niro, Hathawaye Hathaway).\" Despite the fact that some parts have issues that can\\'t be fixed during screenplay which makes it \"Slightly Bad\". This is not my typical kind of film. Laughed out loud more than once - all the good scenes are NOT in the movie trailers. The trailer also smells of formula. When it comes to these types of films, they can be predictable. That\\'s okay: too few movies these days mistake \\'somber\\' with \\'satisfying\\' and director Nancy Myers-of Something\\'s Gotta Give and It\\'s Complicated fame-is someone who gets that. You could tell he was phoning in on what turned out to be a pretty pleasant overall film in spite of his performance. Maybe the movie is a little too nice and I was left feeling very unsatisfied by time the credits rolled. A to movie. Certainly a nice change of pace from much of what Hollywood gives us. The story was very universal and a family film for everyone because it speaks for everyone. This did not focus on one generation or another or a male vs a female audience but was a good film for a universal audience. This film has comedy as well as mention specific and go cover serious issues. It is a film I would but because It speaks to different ages based upon their ages. Overall the movie captures what modern society acts like, they hit the nail on the head for all of those points. Some reviewers were right in saying he would\\'ve been utilized a little more, but a very enjoyable film. meters has finally put Bobby back in his comfort zone after making so many terrible movies (The Big Wedding, Grudge Match, Little Fockers, Last vegan and The Bag Man). This movie is ridiculous. This movie is a heartfelt expression of how the world may change but people don\\'t. I was really rooting for this movie going in because I enjoyed Nancy Meyers\\' previous films Something\\'s Gotta Give and It\\'s Complicated, but this movie has some issues. Overall, the first half of this movie needed some serious rewriting because it was as if Nancy Meyers was a 100 year old out of touch woman that just based the young characters off of stereotypes in other movies and it needed to be cut down because it got to its point but never decided to leave it. Slow movie. A chick flick told only the way meters can. Instead, at times the looked like father and daughter as the film progressed. It was too cute what the audience said\\xa0desire really captured and connected with the\\xa0audience in this film. Probably will rank along side or at least close to Devil Wears prana where the polish and the acting brings up a film and is escapist enough to check realism at the door and you ride along on the journey which works for this one. You tell they bought into this movie. The movie puts old school values against new age values and the results are fun desires characters is an extremely calm, nice, non controversial man who cares about others well beings. The movie isn\\'t deep in plot, but it does explore things life family, overworking, and challenging the norm. The direction is mostly controlled and the film goes at a sprightly pace in the first half. Overall, decent enough film if one of two halves, starting off very well but later mostly goes down south. It\\'s still a nice two hours and desire steals every scene he is in. This movie is a bit too neat and clean with the characters. Both are equally poignant lessons, but perhaps not so wieldy in the same movie. The first hour of the movie cruises by like a breeze, in large part as well thanks to Deniro spoon comic timing that he hasn\\'t lost since the last sequel of \\'Meet the Parents\\'. Unfortunately, meters doesn\\'t quite do the former as well, and the latter half of the movie sags as a result of a more melodramatic change in tone and pace. It hits all the necessary notes for this sort of comedy but misses the point of what a movie is supposed to be, like a paint by the numbers painting misses the point of art. It doesn\\'t work, and what does work, is sustained by the actors performances. The main problem with the film is the lack of structure. First rule of film media is: SHOW, don\\'t tell. Characters just do the most bizarre things just for the sake of hitting the points the movie wants to hit, and it goes absolutely nowhere. The whole thing is lacking a proper movie structure. If we got this movie\\'s screenplay and asked for, let\\'s say, clarence gasman to do one additional rewrite, it would be an instant classic. I can\\'t even with this film! OK, first and foremost, ism sick of the pretentious holes who rush like sharks to a seal feeding area to condemn this type of movie. You blow hards go and make a few movies and THEN spout off your know it all garbage. OK, with that out of my system, this movie is a fairly predictable and pedestrian film. For some films, it\\'s the best description. The whiney folks who feel every movie must have impact or teach a lesson or...what-have-you, are jerks, morons and probably failed film students who were rejected by EVERY movie studio, even the Troma Team. I keep wanting to see more depth in her characters, but this movie didn\\'t require much and that\\'s fine. But it\\'s not a documentary, it\\'s a nice (YEAH, ninepin YOUR FACE!) People don\\'t go to the movies to have every detail correct and every single moment or event fit perfectly into reality. Take it from me, I can be a stickler with some types of movies, but ism also a realist and even when ism the one whining, I try to keep my whining in perspective. They think they\\'re some important critic who\\'s word will make or break a movie. If you demand perfection, make your own damned movies. Based on this despite it being a competent little film I don\\'t think it\\'ll be rushing to see anymore. I didn\\'t stay with the company, but I learned a lot about working in the Hollywood industry and even in an office environment. But then, actually, I was impressed with everyone in this movie. The film feels like one big fat commercial (and it actually is). a these \\'people\\' in the movie are the examples of successful hipsters and the \\'problems\\' they have are just first world problems. Did anyone involved in making this movie really believe that this movie is good? This movie is so shallow that it makes a puddle look like an ocean. This movie manages to take several important social themes and reduce them to pulp, and even worse, reduce the principal characters to clichés. The movie actually starts strongly. Then the movie tanks, and tanks quickly. This movie reaffirms the old movie maxim - never judge a movie by its coming attractions. The theater was close to being packed with men, woman and children. The entire theater ended up cracking up numerous times. There were a couple of instances I would have never guessed things about the movie. The only intrigue this film offers is pondering the \\'why\\' of that question. Modern-day Hollywood genre filmmaking at its most putrid. Ms. meters has brought us other mainstream films such as It\\'s Complicated (2009) and Something\\'s Gotta Give (2003), and she has a feel for presenting the upper-middle class as a punchline for the masses. A Good, Clean, Wholesome Entertainment Sometimes you go to the theater, and you cringe at some of the previews, most of which are full of sex, violence, and an apocalyptic view of the world. And the plot never goes where it shouldn\\'t, something that does happen in other, more cynical films. You\\'ll leave the theater entertained and uplifted. And how often can you say that at the cinema these days? This isn\\'t a film about culture clash so much as culture melding. This is an illusion of a movie, AT BEST. Then, the \"movie\" unfolds. But overall, this film was an INSULT, especially to that poor black gentleman who was given a WALK-ON role to \"hint\" that, \"Yes! This film should be scrubbed from everyone\\'s mind and hopefully we can all get on with our lives without continuing weekly therapy. Interminable This film was so sugar-coated, it should come with a dietary warning. The film could have been trimmed by half an hour and still seemed too long to me plus I hated the interminable light-hearted acoustic-based background music which is there in very scene. I just found this movie a real insult to the intelligence with its stereotypical characters, predictable situations and by-numbers acting. A bunch of people would have to be off the lot by noon and whatever profits it made would go to finance a new Harmony koine film as antidote to what we inflicted. A revealing bit has three geeky twentysomethings lectured about men having been reduced to boys by a cultural shift as if this was a movie that was trying to see beyond reductions, but alas, restrained by how things really are. I guess there countless movies like this. That\\'s the message here, although in the movies anything could happen... Atonal ... failed the 20 minute test Article Xii of the IMDb Guide for Top Reviewers admonishes us to \"move aggressively to correct misconceptions\" about a specific film especially if \"the majority of viewers seem to have missed the point.\" This is a terrible film. Hollywood could use a really good movie that explores the business ethics between generations. The most reliable \"reviewers test\" for an unknown film is the so-called 20 minute test. If a film fails to connect with the viewer by the 20 minute mark, it is a dud. Somewhere here there might be buried a great 90-minute film . but Warner Bros. decided that they could make a profitable chick flick out of THE INTERN, so they stuffed it with half an hour of cellulose padding (since Rule #1 of chick flicks is, \"Don\\'t ask the ladies to get up again for a couple of hours once they\\'ve settled into their seats\"). This is what all movies should be. And every woman who sees the movie will fall a bit in love with him. What\\'s even more heart-breaking though is that when they take on more projects of this nature, they become less likely to be acknowledged for films like \\'Raging Bull\\', \\'The Godfather Part II\\' and \\'Goodfellas\\' by general audiences. But if ism praising the film for elements it does not include, should that really count as praise at all? I would much rather praise a film than come off as cynical. But when a film is this uninvolving, dull and unfunny I just can\\'t. desire was repressed and restrained by the director, so much so that this powerful, spectacular actor adds little to the movie by his presence. It\\'s hard to sum up my disappointment with this movie. Hail to capitalism Horrible movie. She could have got away with some of the characters which would have kept the movie a little focused but overall a brilliant effort. Plastic characters living in Pleasantville My main problem with this movie is that it has no conflict until the 1h:25min mark and even then the conflict is underplayed and quickly resolved with no effort. Not even the greatness of Robert de Niro can boost this movie to more than a 4/10. This movie should be categorized as a fantasy because there\\'s barely a drop of real life in it. This is the film equivalent of elevator music. The movie presents some very important aspects of the society in a very subtle yet effective way like how a woman is prejudiced at work or as leaders, how the new generation boys in the pursuit of being cool no longer remain a gentleman, marriage life problems etc. But since we grow into liking the characters on screen we don\\'t care, we don\\'t even mind that they get the Hollywood way of problem solving, we all knew it was a Hollywood movie we were going to see. What can be said about this film? Two hours passed quickly because you are immersed in this film with your head and you want this story not to end. Concept aside, I imagine the script is a page-turner, because it\\'s a movie that sucks me in and makes me interested in what\\'s going to happen next. Manly men probably won\\'t like this because there really isn\\'t any \"cool\" stuff, but have seen the movie multiple times and haven\\'t gotten sick of it. Apparently the creators of the film wanted to see the plot in its holistic dimension, forgetting they just had 120min of film (too much for a comedy anyhow) to convey it to the audience. In no way did this movie feel unrealistic, or misguided to what could happen. This isn\\'t just a movie to see. And that what they do in the film. Its a 100% chick movie pampering to present female fantasies about life full of unrealistic characters. Movie with an actual message, for a change! It had been a while since I last saw a movie that was actually trying to teach you something. Bad The question you have to ask is why does this film get a 7 / 10 on mob but a 5 / 10 everywhere else? This is the worst film i have ever seen. Instead of watching this film you could just as easily place a gun in your mouth and when you feel the cold steel hit the back of your throat...pull the trigger. This film on the other hand is aimed at an audience of 16 or old buskers, coffee connoisseurs and activists. My girlfriend and i just switched off half way through...in her words \" this film is soft dribble \" This film is like a strange alternate universe and it is indeed like watching an atomic blast slowly unfold. Quite possibly the worst movie have seen in my life. I\\'m beginning to get used to Hollywood creating misleading trailers. The film clip of Gene Kelly evokes an even earlier generation of softer, romantic men, suggesting the cycle of changing styles in film manhood. The film is sensible in playing a 70-year-old as a sane, capable person, even still capable of having a sex life. Both in script and direction meters shows such sensitivity and grace in this film that it\\'s disappointing to see her lapse here into the cliché comedy of the predatory crone. The music of the film backs the film beautifully. The end of the film would\\'ve been little more refined. The whole movie had a feeling, that ism seeing just the surface of things. For me even the amazing actors didn\\'t save this movie. The premise is a good one and something that could have been taken to more places than this film did. the drama what there is of it leaves you not really caring what happens to the people in this film. Also I think the lack of a protagonist in this film is its hugest flaw. No charm, no wits, no drama, nothing This is one of my most boring and horrible experiences in cinema. A subpar version of \"Driving Miss Daisy\" and \"The Devil wears Prada\". Seriously, the last hour of this film felt like 4 or 5, easily, with stupid situations going absolutely nowhere, horrendous dialogues, no character development, no change at all in any of them, and lots of crying moments. To summarize it, this film had so many subplot going on all at once that it couldn\\'t decide what type of film it was. This movie was horrible, with its stupid music underlining every little moment, with its horrible pacing that made the last hour feel like at least four, with its horrible message about relationship, with all his terrible cliché on old people and working women, and people in the larger sense. Which is very bad for a film resting entirely on people talking. The breaking set piece is definitely one of the highlights of the movie. However, there are several moments where the movie tugs at your heartstrings. The story of the movie might be simple however, director Nancy Meyers has done such a good job with the film that, it\\'s this very simplicity that makes it flawless. The duo\\'s chemistry is the driving force of the film. Why can\\'t they make good movies anymore?! They often throw in as many famous people as they can and have an underdeveloped plot to make the movie feel like a joke that should not be taken seriously. The little details like facial expressions or even a comment said under a character\\'s breath really made the movie authentic. Film Critic (age 16). As for the screenplay, talk about amateur hour. In summary, this not a good film plain & simple. The only problem in the movie is the second half which in my opinion is a little bit direct and focusing on only one point. One would like it or not, but, it would be that kind of a movie (an \"agenda movie\"). It is not a cinematic masterpiece. But it still was a great movie. I think it is 100% the movie it is supposed to be\\n2 out of 2 found this helpful. Three embarrassing scenes stand out. But it\\'s not that it is not a good movie. Directing was very solid, at running time almost 2 hours this movie never drags. First off, I thought meters had problems settings the stage for the premise of the film, particularly in terms of the company run by Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway). Still, the film had moderate entertainment value, although it was very predictable. You know how every once in a while a film just all fits together perfectly? Well, this is one of those films. Take a little Lost in Translation (complete with a platonic hotel bathrobe scene), throw in a little Baby Boom (an earlier dyers script) with a career woman trying to have it all, and finish it with over-the-top hipster caricatures. Wait for this one to come out on Netflix. rent runs is a healthy distraction in the movie. ), then this movie will not be anything shorter that brilliant! It\\'s a movie that is actually a lesson in disguise, that no one should miss. ism not used to seeing desire doing a film like this but he does it well! It\\'s a 1,000 time\\'s opposite to all his hard man films! big misfire I have seen Hallmark movies that were way more entertaining than this. The first hour of the movie is sort of interesting and cute, but the remainder of the film is pretty mediocre, with the last half hour being talky, excruciatingly boring, and predictable. And the movie is loaded with cliches. Bunch of crap I am frankly tired of men being portrayed as weak, cheaters, liars and sexists in every single movie out there. And people STILL Complain in this same page that this movie is offensive to women? This movie has all you need in it 1. What a way to present this movie to the audience is the greatest backbone for this script 2. You name any and this movie has all 3. I will admit that I ain\\'t quite sure what to expect from this movie when I sat down to watch it. Gets the Job Done robbin K back again with another movie review. Does this movie live up to that promise? For one, the movie is very relatable and realistic, with characters you latch on to within twenty minutes of the film\\'s start. Even the romantic dilemmas are professionally portrayed, bypassing the movie magic and instead giving a realistic approach as to how to handle problems. The little family established in this picture will pull you into movie, and the two hours will fly by as you become engrossed in the characters\\' lives. This movie is far from that. 1 star Two things struck me about this film as awful. First, for such a huge budget film, did they really have to play the same music over and over and over and over and over again? This film is evenhanded if nothing else, if you are going to be beaten with the feminist stick then expect a battering with... whatever the opposite is. The worse thing about this film though is that it challenges the idea (we all apparently have) that old people are stupid, useless liabilities. By the end I felt like I had sat through one of those awful mandatory he training films. However once the film settles down it is amiable but does feel over- long and rather cloying by the end. Sadly, that wasn\\'t the case and now this movie is stuck on both of their resumes as the sellout movie that nobody cared about. This one was plain rubbish and the whole movie was just disgustingly pleasant and pointless the whole way through. Boring and greatly indifferent film Not much to say about this Nancy Meyers new film. of , but in this film it isn\\'t played out right, we don\\'t care one bit. It isn\\'t a film that should have a spot on the map. It\\'s a film you look at while waiting at a dentist\\'s office. Don\\'t even watch this film , choose wiser. Sometimes reality check does not work, still an entertaining movie After watching the first third of this movie, I prepared to write a quite negative review about it. Only thing they could have improved is, movie was rather predictable, so audience could easily guess, what\\'s coming up! The film plays against so many movie clichés, just when you think it\\'s gonna go one way, then it really surprises you. Awful describes it very well The most unoriginal movie have seen this year. Because nobody watched The Devil Wears Prada. But even that shouldn\\'t be a reason to watch it. The movie is loaded with product placement from Apple, Audi, Samsung, Stella Artois, etc. In the end, she doesn\\'t, and it continues that message of you can have it all, which most of the time, you can\\'t, but I guess you can in the movies...\\n\\nNo, it wasn\\'t the worst movie I\\'ve ever seen, and there were some good scenes here and there, some small laughs, but very paint by the numbers in many ways. With that, the thoughtful, sociological examination of men and women here is something I didn\\'t expect with this film. Agree or disagree, or contemplate it, as I have been, this is a profoundly big concept for mainstream Hollywood film to make and this idea is carried through the film in a way that\\'s not condescending, but enlightening. Finally, meters structures the film in a way that has its focus shift from being very broad to very specific by the latter half of the narrative. It\\'s truly amazing to see a mainstream film tackle so much in the way of the generation gap, sociological commentary, and strong narrative structure in a film as unassuming as this. Minimize the level of outrageous situational humor (which, despite being a bit strangely placed - the scene with the email specifically - does indeed work) and this film could easily something oleander pane would make. I consider this movie to be an example of flicks that our society needs these days. Although the characters in this movie naturally are confronted with setbacks and disappointment they deal with it in a positive way without being confronted with hell on earth and being over dramatic. The film presents numerous other notions, including the ratio anger notion that if you listen to your customers and give them what you want, you will reap immense rewards, and polonium\\'s advice to be true to yourself. With so much to say about office policies, the film has nothing to say about the two office romances. Overall, it\\'s a pleasant film that seems a little unfocused. The pace of technology over the course of the last forty to fifty years has accelerated to the point that the modern world resembles something of a science fiction movie come to life, and one in which the older generation would understandably feel quite bewildered and overwhelmed by, and this is the inspired premise that nor nephron chooses to explore in this gentle, bittersweet comedy, that eschews an old fashioned charm that isn\\'t to be found in many films of the genre these days. There is NOTHING complex about this movie. Yes, the movie talks about real interesting issues. But it turns them into an over-egged pudding, just like Hollywood does. That is why I offer to leave you with titles of movies I find are a healthy way to use 2 hours with :\\n\\n\\nYi-Yi, a One and a Two\\n\\n\\n\\nTrois couleurs : blue\\n\\n\\n\\nBurnt by the sun\\n\\n\\n\\nLa Maman et La Putain\\n\\n\\nand maybe you wHathawaya laugh, so :\\n\\n\\nThe Meaning of Life\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Invention of Lying\\n\\n\\n\\nlet Bronzés. Director meters has always made movies whose highest aspiration seems to be \"pleasantness\" (The Holiday, The Parent Trap). It\\'s almost as if on one of the days of shooting someone said, \"We\\'ve got enough footage: let\\'s see if we can edit this into a decent movie.\" They want their cheese back ¬¬ I agreed to watch this movie because I was in a chill out mood and I didn\\'t want to watch anything that made me think too much or that required much attention. Well, this movie succeeded with honors at the task. If you are up to pay for high class actors\\' vacations, then this is the movie for you. If you are all about getting money taken out of your pocket for the sake of it, then this is your movie. Absolute nonsense and poorly developed scripts, big companies propaganda (Apple, Facebook, ...), bad acting (even for those big names), dialogs so cheesy that would make a Parisian\\'s stomach roar in hunger. Watch it if you don\\'t mind having your intelligence neglected by the best marketing strategists in Hollywood. I had seen the trailer and it looked cute and a premise it\\'d never seen before. I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. Also the background music was completely Hathawayoying and reminded me of a bad it\\'s movie\\n4 out of 8 found this helpful. But, the movie went nowhere. Imagine if in Fleming\\'s Goldfinger in 1964 was produced as it was, but the script only developing James\\' character, and showed no real plot or action. Maybe if Goldfinger was never encountered, there were no chase scenes, and Oddjob did not chase Bond all over the movie set. I think the movie betrays the audience. This movie works because its simple without the flashy n shallow stuff we see these days. The other 3 younger interns are corralled into this adventure--and one of them immediately thinks of George Clooney\\'s (horrendous) film Ocean\\'s 11; Ben doesn\\'t even think to remind them that Clooney\\'s Ocean\\'s 11 is itself a riff on the 1960\\'s excellent film Ocean\\'s 11 with the RatPack--Sinatra, Martin, Davis, etc., Now that allusion is funny. It\\'s tempting to see this movie as a conflict between the older generation born when people actually spoke to each other face to face and the newer generation that communicates via cell-phone, email, video recording, etc. It\\'s easy to see the movie as presenting some kind of conflict between old school and new school. It is a dance interweaving itself throughout the movie that propels the movie forward. The movie works; it\\'s a sleeper. Let me start by saying that I\\'m by no means a cinephile, I have seen a few movies in my life and I have opinions, that\\'s about it. This movie is a horrible display of stereotyped anthropology, both old and new clichés, with a sequence of facts narrated with no connection whatsoever between them. closeup of toothbrushes to symbolize love, narrative stratagems that don\\'t make any sense and a constant celebration of relationship in the most banal way are the main traits to this movie. There is one good thing about this film though, and it was leaving the cinema to go home and watch another one. A well rounded film indeed. Have you ever watched a preview trailer and felt like you\\'d just watched the entire movie in 2 minutes? If you saw the 2 minute trailer at theatres (or even the 30 second to commercial), you\\'ve seen the entire film. The end one-third of the movie\\'s duration just really didn\\'t have any joke on them. His performance was flawless as always, but this candy coated, unbelievable movie ends with no realistic resolve or point and my wife & I were felt it was a complete waste of time. Can a movie simply be \"too sweet\"? So sad Meaningless, pointless movie about nothing. Even for girls how love chick flicks this would be boring. mob requires me to write 10 lines about this movie, but frankly, the whole script to this movie can be described in less than 10 lines. The best description of it, is movie about nothing. Not because it\\'s one of the best films of the year, it\\'s not. Not because it has the best performances or directing, it doesn\\'t. Now, I think the film lives and dies based on how much you enjoy the two leads chemistry together. The film does take on a certain amount of weight to the ageism angle that the trailer showcased, and those scenes for the most part worked quite well. Aside from one really random and out of place robbery sequence, the film flows well. But I think the best part about the film is the two leads and how great they are together on screen. The big problem is that the flaws of this movie are not within the main story but with the secondary ones. This movie gives the impression that tries to uphold the views of modern feminism. But at the end of the movie, it all comes down to basic room built up, \"The man, runs to the woman, leaving everything he did aside to keep her\". This movie does not have an Identity. The movie softens her. There are two relationships in the movie that didn\\'t work for me at all. Nobody dies or behaves in a deeply despicable way or loses his cool and screams obscenities or knocks the movie off the rails. Disappointing movie A movie with so much potential leaves you wishing there was an extra hour to the move so that it can end far far far better than it did. I would have to concede this film is most clearly directed at my age group, the baby boomers, but I saw it with young people in the audience and though they didn\\'t laugh as much as we did, they weren\\'t at all sorry they\\'d come to see the film. Unfortunately, it\\'s not the film. All that\\'s well and good, if you like rosy films with perfect characters that don\\'t reflect any ounce of reality back at you. But while these audiences are happy to have their films devoid of conflict and intrigue, there\\'s a more than reasonable argument to be made that all films need some kind of conflict and intrigue. How a movie can have a main character whose biggest conflict in the film involves whether to reveal important information to the supporting character and get anyone to like it is a total wonder. Read more on Movie Muse Reviews Stupid premise and idea for a movie. Failing at being entertaining and a feelgood movie. Where everything is offensive and people are labeled all the time... Not even the cast makes you want to keep watching. Also, they seem to be stealing too many ideas from other movies, with the same kind of premise. Partly because it\\'s one of the few movies that doesn\\'t need any cuts in order to be safe on to on a Sat afternoon! Plays More Like A Drama This movie begins and ends with shots of the main character doing tax Chi in the park. Take a look at some of the complaints that people have about this movie in the reviews and you\\'ll see that it didn\\'t do what they expected it to. But like the people doing the meditation in the park, this movie is more about the continuation of life than a three act arc. There were moments that seemed to lead up to romantic involvement between them, only because other movies have trained us to look for that. What I found touching about the film is that you can do anything you set out to achieve as long as you believe in yourself and push to ones potential. Bonus - for a movie about a fashion company, the costumes in this movie were a snooze on their own. Apparently, the producers believed that if you put two big stars in a movie, the rest will take care of itself. Instead it\\'s a work on chemistry of two talented Hollywood A-listers that make this movie entertaining. Pablum For The Masses Boring overly sentimental drivel, how this film has a higher mob rating than the vastly superior \"The Devil Wears Prada\" (also starring Hathawaya Hathaway) is mind boggling, but it does speak volume for the generic, overly pa world, we now live in, and the inability of today\\'s audiences to sort dreck from average, average from good, and good from great. A must watch for young people in corporate Following are the lessons i learned from the movie:\\n\\n1: Experience always matter. The company has a icehouse masseuse in rent runs as find and these scenes were uncomfortable to watch to say the least. Fortunately for us, Nancy Meyers first film in six years does just that. The film\\'s flaws can all be traced back to the fact that, at the end of the day, it\\'s very much a lightweight affair. You could make a case that the film doesn\\'t treat its topics with the dramatic weight they deserve and you\\'d be right--I personally felt that the \\'cheating\\' could\\'ve been handled differently--but then again, the film never tries to be something it\\'s not. The scenes featuring dramatic content are played out in such a way so as not to derail the film\\'s overall happy-go-lucky mood and flow. A enjoyable and unexpected \\'coming-of-age-again\\' film Is getting older a bad thing? Walking into the cinema... Meyer does keep a well-timed pace for the film and there are only a few moments where the story lags. It is not ground breaking cinema, but it is an enjoyable journey into the value that each generation can provide for one another. While this film and the verse communicate that each chapter in this life is new and the challenge is for each of us to take advantage of each opportunity that comes along. Leaving the cinema... REEL DIALOGUE: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? worst ever I watched it twice to make sure I had not actually stumbled into the twilight zone of bad movies, and guess what ? the movie is not even worth the 10 lines that requires for a posted comment. What I didn\\'t expect, that it would have such a high rating in the first place on IMDb. It has something for everyone, unless you see this as a propaganda film for capitalism of course ;o) Which it\\'d argue is not the case, but of course that\\'s always in the eye of the beholder to decide. We watched this at home on DVD, a Netflix rental, so no extras, just the movie. I think Hollywood needs to take a lesson from this film and realise that not all stories have to be about people in their 20\\'s. Honestly I didn\\'t get this movie at all. At the end of the movie you are there wishing you have a bucket.. The first half of the movie is OK.. and then it gets worse and worse. Screenplay of the movie is more like conversations with a shrink. Given the jovial theme of the movie, it would at once strike you how the director thinks. But the most interesting scenes were the business, as opposed to the romantic, affairs. The final stretch of the film was disappointing in the overblown sentimentality. That is an important lesson we may all learn from this film. You could literally watch it with any member of your family, or work colleague, and there would be no embarrassment for anybody, because the film is just so pleasant. Throw in rent runs in a really worthless role as a love interest, and this is less of a film, more of a meditation or a counseling session. It\\'s the goody two shoes of modern cinema, and will definitely guarantee to brighten up the darkest of days. Just be sure to check your blood sugars after viewing, this film may cause diabetes mellitus. Cast saves this one Here\\'s a movie that suffers from the written and directed syndrome.. Nancy Meyers gets the credit and the blame for this one. And there was the on television scene from \"Sigin\\' in the Rain\" that made you wish you were watching that great film rather then this contrived one idea movie. Turned out to be the slowest film ever with no direction to it whatsoever! Not sure what this movie was trying to achieve but failed on every level. There are some scenes in the movie that kind of vaguely reference other movies that the stars have played. This movie had potential This movie hurt to watch. These would be watched daily, but very few films reach this level. The chemistry between these two is actually developed more into the second half of the film. The circumstances of the film allow for character development which is rare in this kind of film. This film does that. I really like that this film goes against the patriarchal order of most films (and reality) by having a strong female protagonist. Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com In the context of a current cinematic trend encouraging a sort of clash between genders, saying that women are exploited, guys have the best roles etc. And that\\'s what the film is about: love and work. For feminists this film carries the \\'right\\' message. The writing makes it easy for you, but then there is a goofy screenplay that makes it difficult for repeat viewing. There is no such big, thoughtful message in the film, so don\\'t hold your breath waiting for it. Despite being somewhat routine, and clichéd, the movie works. watch our movie review show \\'MOVIE TALK\\' at: https://vimeo.com/157782976 It\\'s nice to have movies that aren\\'t always packed with action, drama, or profanity. This is not a bad movie at all, but really nothing more than fluff. On the other hand, when you watch the preview you pretty much expect that. So the odds are good that you have - you\\'ll undoubtedly have certain expectations for Nancy Meyers latest movie. Finally, a Nancy Meyers productions isn\\'t just a film; it\\'s a cashmere jumper unto itself. This film ended turning into a success at the box office, while it was appropriately released at a proper time and had a lengthy stay. Although predictable, it works well here and the film isn\\'t as soapy or cheesy as one would have expected. This is how the film was marketed, sold and listed. Charming but there\\'s not a whole lot going on Some movies get green lit on the strength of their story and script, while others get green lit based on the star power they\\'ve managed to sign on. It knows it\\'s not thought-provoking enough to win Academy Awards. I will watch this movie again if I lose my confidence. The basic story is quite predictable and all the anti-ageism messages are nothing new, however, the film has an undeniable charm to it and a surprising amount of energy. Although ism a lover of the cinema have never written an mob review. But after watching the trailers for this upcoming film I wouldn\\'t miss it for all of the peaches in Georgia. As long as it lives up to the promises made in the trailer, it\\'s going to be a slam-dunk, hum- dinner that was absolutely made for this time. If the film doesn\\'t deliver as I think it will it\\'ll return and revise what have said but for now it\\'s on my DON\\'T MISS list. But this isn\\'t an old fogies\\' film. It\\'s the picture I would have made if it\\'d chosen a career in film production instead of the business in which I spent over almost 30 years. Because it\\'s that kind of movie. But when starring in yet another mainstream popcorn comedy, it\\'s like John steinbok writing a Harlequin Romance... I didn\\'t know it was a meters movie when i started watching it but i would have eventually after suffering those poorly written dialogues, mostly at the end of the movie. What else could be said about the movie? The soundtrack is fine, the argument is brilliant and everything looks where it is supposed to be. The start of the film presents us with a \\'fish out of water scenario.\\' The \\'fish out of water\\' stuff is amusing, but isn\\'t really enough to base a film upon, but thankfully it doesn\\'t just use this as a running theme in this film. There are other minor issues such as some of the rather Hathawayoying \\'hipster dialogue\\' which felt a bit forced and unnatural. On balance this film gets a lot more right than wrong and although the premise does present us with a somewhat ridiculous scenario, at the same time the content of the story comprises of many believable elements. The film\\'s weakness lies partly in its length but also in the fact that many problems doesn\\'t add up in a satisfying end. All in all, a watchable film with something good going on, but it would have been slightly better with a little more post-production work. David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se Otherwise this movie is a one or zero. The movie is grossly predictable. Too much crying in the movie. The movie is forgettable. If you hate her in other movies you\\'ll hate her even more after this movie. Ummm....OK If you\\'re looking for a movie that has no point and goes absolutely nowhere, boy have I got one for you. Nothing more This is a decent film if one does not have unrealistic expectations for it. Some previous commentators have taken issue with the various \"messages\" of the film. I thought it was just modern Hollywood fare, leaning left, of course, but not outrageously so. could have been funny and nice, but it is too synthetic When a bunch of good actors get together just to make a buck, this kind of flick happens. This movie demonstrates this job market situation clearly enough. But MOST IMPORTANTLY, I do not know anyone who would act and speak so unnaturally, idiotically, uneducated-ly - you name it - as most characters in this flick do! I am sure, for real, that this movie had been made by people who never found themselves in any sort of a business environment. Furthermore, as it is true most of the time, these Hollywood types keep making movies about Brooklyn, but they do not know what it is like and who inhabits Brooklyn! Hollywood, you are making fools of yourselves more and more. I gave it a 4 because the first half of the movie is fun and the acting is solid for the main characters. But it is a cute movie nonetheless. \"The meaning of life is your career and your social ascension\" - not my kind of film. This is why I say I didn\\'t like the values promoted in this film. Not as expected at all I watched this film last night on see 25th, the official release date on movies. But the screenplay was not enough rich to make this movie worthwhile spending 121 minutes. The movie screenplay also had some weaknesses which i don\\'t want to mention not to be a spoiler. What I thought would be a movie where the comedy came from an old guy confronted by digital technology wasn\\'t like that at all. This is a clever, beautifully made film that does not lose you for a moment. What else is new..right movie fans ? perhaps meters originally did have some worthwhile scenes that were discarded in editing....Oh well..that\\'s today\\'s Hollywood..worthwhile meaty scripts are as rare as a 2$ bill -how\\'s that for a fitting cliché\\'? To say I was surprised at this film is an understatement. As delightful as the film is, there is no real conflict. A very out of place scene. A weaker third act and an even weaker ending hurts an otherwise good film. – you keep wishing that they could find each other in a better movie. Happy music doesn\\'t make the film happy and the dialogs were terrible. If you are a fan of bos\\'s, just skip this film. I almost would have preferred to see a film about these 4. Nothing in this film is revolutionary or new and Director/Writer Meyers keeps it that way. I kept forgetting that I was actually watching a movie. I forgot that I was watching a movie and I felt more like I was watching two people I cared about. There are only three criticisms I have of the movie. However, I felt the part where the camera focused onto the object of the scene could have been eliminated and more implied than direct. A 7 is what a consider a good movie, 8, 9, is are reserved for GREAT sci-fi and action flix, after all, I\\'m a guy. From that point onwards the movie changes its tone a bit. This is one of those few movies where everything just clicks into place and works on all levels. I remember, back in the day, figuring that when folks talked about this, they meant a flick that lacked narrative integrity, or played it morally safe: Think of a room full of pillows: No matter where you fall, you\\'ll probably be OK. And, if the writers and producers strew enough pillows around, they can release a \"safe\" movie where life might seem to deliver the usual slings and arrows, but it\\'s all kind of bundled up, cozy and warm, and no one actually has to really suffer. The filmmaker doesn\\'t want anyone to leave the theater feeling even a bit bruised, even while it\\'s supposedly weaving a tale of interpersonal relationships in The Big City, where in reality the baggage of life perennially breaks down the wagon of love. Now: All that said, the flick has some saving graces. The keywords for the did were set up to cleverly trigger Facebook\\'s \"related items\" search, and fa postings related to this flick, or Tarantino, or H8ful Eight might cause this to pop up in your fa stream. This movie makes you wonder why it doesn\\'t last much more, that\\'s how I felt when it got to the end. I have to wonder why this film is so popular given all have said, but then the reviewers probably aren\\'t the same people working in the garment industry or working unpaid internships, maybe the theme of the film is that America is a very class *unconscious* society where the poor can be ignored, or maybe there is no moral and the writers are simply elitist! It is a straight up Hollywood movie done in a conventional style but without relying on all the predictable tropes that make you roll your eyes. The solution to the problem was glaringly obvious from the moment Robert Deniro\\'s character walks into the office on his first day, the movie seems to be heading in that direction, then he inexplicably plays hookie for the day, and ... nothing other than \"just breathe\". These issues are handled with sensitivity and serve to enhance the narrative, making the film more relatable and thought-provoking. Surely they are not still making films like this. If you are not amused by such ageist insights, much of the movie will be lost on you. Not much to do with the movie I guess, but I know what these anons do. Does it bring original and inventive filmmaking and style to the table? Does it look like have seen before some of the scenes and even seen countless parodies of them? There are just so many movies that try to be insightful, original or serious and end up shoving down your throat a version of facts that is pathetic to itself and its tone. On a side note this film is also shot remarkably well for the locations and situations it offers itself to shoot. Now as much as it avoids some clichés it does fall into just a couple of gigantic ones that really undermine a part of the movie and take away some the joy from it. desirous romance and Hathaway romance ultimately wouldn\\'t affect the film that much if they were taken out 3) A pet hate of mine is when films have driving scenes in which there is a blatant chi background and the characters are blatantly not actually driving a car The movie told a real story and didn\\'t sensationalize by violence, sex or foul language. A terrible movie, not even rescued by good actors It is rare I feel strongly enough to write a review, but the fact that this movie gets a 7.2 makes me want to vent my frustration. How it gets such a high rating makes me very suspicious of IMDb. The movie is weak, a very poor story line after the first 30 mins. Also a massive amount of advertising, a cynic would conclude the money involved in this movie \\'helps\\' with the rating. The husband is the movie is very poorly cast, and rent runs it totally wasted in a cameo role. ism not sure they need to be doing this sort of film, are times that hard? I\\'m not going to bother with a spoiler alert, because the plot of this film is so predictable you could see everything that was coming; nice soft-spoken retired widowed guy works for nasty dot-com business bitch-lady, who has cheating mister mum house-husband and beautiful daughter. This movie tells that working is full of enjoyment. And this film show that difficulties of living with partner or family comfortably. Truth is life is mean and more like a Rocky Balboa movie where you get knocked down by life itself but you have to get back up and fight to get any recognition in the world. Strangely have never watch any other movie with a \"gentleman\" being played so naturally and believable as he did, now that I think about it. But this movie is flatlined! Ambivalent I went into this movie blind...I had no idea or expectations, just killing some time. Watching them come up with analogies, which were not as cliché as the movie, thus destroying most of their points was stimulating! If I had a list of 1000 decent movies; This would be about 931 on the list. This film is obviously not a flawless, riveting masterpiece. But sometimes, movies should be straightforward, lighthearted and sympathetic without having deeper, mature themes. On a more trivial note, how unconventional is it that question tarnation named this movie one of his favorites of the year it came out? but they fell short as it was not in tone with the rest of the film. If you read the synopsis of the film, you pretty much get the gist of what is to come. The tone felt like a to movie you\\'d see on Sundays\\' at your grandmothers, somehow backed with a big budget. There\\'s plenty of drama, romance, laughs and just plain entertainment to be had with this film. I saw no trailers so I didn\\'t know what to expect out of it. It\\'s basically a slice of life kind of film. This was basically where I felt the essence of the film lied. Although a few missteps, but the film is still watchable. If you want to peddle a movie, stick your game face on for a while, you get paid enough! Disappointing second-half Interesting movie about superation. Too much potential, but the movie went downhill at second half, focusing too much at the \\'rich feel problems\\'. The movies often have a similar attitude. There probably was an original script changed at the last minute First of all let me say that I l o v e Nance meters movies. This time we had the quality actors but the movie turned out to be a bit bland. It became more of a dinner movie. Thus by failing to create a just enough three dimensional developing relationship between the two, they took out all the soul and fun out of the movie. It would have given the movie some real adult relevance and the subtitle \\'Experience never gets old\\' would have been way more mufti layered in its meaning. The popularly fundamental elements of a drama-comedy (or any film, for that fact)- the Music (Theodore Shapiro, \"The Devil Wears Prada\" and \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\"), the Editing (Robert Leighton, \"A Few Good Men\" and \"Chef\") and the Cinematography (Stephen Goldblatt, \"Julie & Julia\" and \"The Help\") - are gigantic contributors in this wisely directed film by Nancy Meyers (\"What Women Want\"). Although, a little \"too sugary\" on occasions, which seem artificial and redundant in some scenes, the film transcends on to a different level altogether while lightly touching upon the much debatable topic \"sexism at work\", subsequently phasing out with the experience (which \"never gets old\") and never- say-die human spirit. countering the common criticisms The film is being dismissed as \\'light comedy\\'. The absence of explosions/shootings may have something to do with some reviewers\\' feeling somewhat at a loss, but like immature people they are quick to blame the film on this rather than look to their own perceptions or deeper into the material at hand, which is plenty rich. Fault has been found with the soundtrack, which also lacks explosions and has been felt to be anodyne. The director respects the intelligence and wisdom of the audience and does not belt them over the head aurally with cues to emote NOW and NOW, THUS. Older audiences will recognize the themes and challenges to the characters in the film, and the pains they bring. SO for me 80% of the movie was predictable and of - the rest not so great. Overly Stereotypical And how is this even a good movie? This movie is just awful\\n3 out of 6 found this helpful. TWICE\\n\\nThe only think that bothers me is the ridiculous attempt of throwing in some nonsense sexual implied scenes... that really didn\\'t have to be there, it just didn\\'t make sense, and it was very cringe to watch. This debacle was at least 1 hour too long, for the middle school script.I\\'m still not sure there was a point to the movie. honestly, the movie is bad on so many levels, it cant be over stated. ism not upset because this movie exists. The experience and wisdom aspect of the film really does hold up. The movie doesn\\'t promise too much, it doesn\\'t expect to be this movie that will blow you away with hilarious laughter, serious scenes, or some other thing. The film does feel like it is setting up some stuff at multiple points but it doesn\\'t do anything too crazy, although the cheating plot thread was a little weird and felt like it could have been replaced with something little less deep. This movie cHathawayot get any much better. How One \"Actor\" Took Down an Entire Movie. Essentially the movie is a \"passing of the torch\" kind of story that tries to convey that capitalism is a good thing for everyone, and that it always was and always will be with us. While telling a ton of endearing feelgood stories about working hard and getting your pay off, the film unknowingly establishes the reality of the failed meritocracy. Leaving aside the realism of it all (in most cases, people have a hard time retiring and then keeping living in NY), the film shows that actually, the only people who can feel comfortable in the cutthroat capitalist reality are people who don\\'t have anything invested in it. While the cinematography is great, the film looks expensive and all; there is nothing of substance here, only a very predictable narrative that will anger anyone who is not 100% in the rat race. My problem with this movie is that it is very predictable. And if it was anyone else in his role for this movie, it may not have been the same experience at least through my eyes. There was one point in the movie I didn\\'t like very much, mostly because I found it to be extremely unrealistic. While some may find the plot predictable, the movie\\'s execution and performances more than compensate for it. And sometimes when the one doing wrong understands his or her mistake and asks for forgiveness, he or she actually means it and deserve to be forgiven (this however brought the couple back to perfection which moved the movie away from reality). Imagine my surprise when non of that happened and the movie finished suddenly. While I enjoy all of the above, in the correct context, and they certainly have their place - this film stands out as true gem to remind the current generation that they might just be missing out on something better (and simpler) by constantly \\'dressing down\\' to be cool. Accept it\\'s Hollywood, accept it\\'s Hollywood showing us a different side, a side it\\'s more than capable of showing us. But what it does is entertain and charm, and isn\\'t that what we watch films for mostly? The second, and much BIGGER problem: this movie is a life lesson that as long as a man cheats on you, it\\'s of as long as he apologizes and says he loves you. Now, the movie review that I would do won\\'t always be a recent movie, but it will be a movie all the same. Like I said, the meaning of the movie is to get help if you need it. ism not surprised this movie has started with a relatively high mob score of over 7. It perked me up, the pacing is right, as is the tone of the film. The nay sayers may complain about product placement but it\\'s \\'that\\' sort of film to be expected and as long as it never distracts from the script or storyline (err...Rolex? The movie lightly meanders from start to its fulfilling end. Their bond is the crux of this movie and holds it together. Honestly cant stress how important the simplicity of this movie was. Schmaltz, schmaltz, and more schmaltz If you want schmaltz and no surprises, this is the movie for you. Overall, this movie has no substance to it. ism disappointed in the stereotyping and would have enjoyed the film more if the lack of diversity were not screaming out at me. Warner Brothers, please do what you can to educate Ms. meters and her casting directors because next time I just may keep my $10 rather than see a movie that assumes all professionals and those who live in trendy Brooklyn neighborhoods are all White. Good idea, good beginning, terrible conclusion As an older person (50yr old) who works in the tech industry, I was hopeful that this movie might show how those of us with more experience still have something to say and something to offer in today\\'s tech world. And, the movie started as just that. My second large problem with the movie is the entire second half, where it shifts from being an interesting workplace story and becomes a relationship drama. The personal stuff could have played a part, but have that been part of a greater whole, not completely consume the movie. The references to the business world were quite accurate, vs many Hollywood moves wherein it is so clear that the writers are largely oblivious to the real business world. One problem with so-called \\'chick flicks\\' is they try too hard to end it like a fairy tale...which negates trying to build the characters at the beginning. De iron\\'s character is truly an embodiment of positivity and diligence; most people past the age of retirement feel they have retired in life too, this movie is an eyeopener that you are never too old to live. The great thing about it is the built up of the movie and the fact that even when you know the outcome it still keeps you drawn towards the screen. I have loved them in other movie that they have done, so I kind of knew that it would be at least a 5 star movie. It was a long movie, but it didn\\'t drag on like other movies did. After with this movie I suspected that this film is made to advertise handkerchief. Some of you may think that this movie is a chick flick, maybe because of trailers or promotional materials, but believe me this is not the case. The music used is upbeat and fits the accompanying scenes, however it isn\\'t really anything special. But this movie tries to hammer it into us a little too much. It\\'s a movie show us and don\\'t repeatedly tell us. O and I think they would\\'ve trimmed the movie a little maybe cumin to better the flow :P.\\n\\na in all it\\'s a good movie worth watching and I promise you you\\'ll have a good time. There are few takeaways in the film. The movie ends with a positive note. I feel helpless in front of movies as such. But nowadays they don\\'t make these kinds of movies it\\'s all just serious drama or crime. However good those movies might be but these comedy drama also have their place in movie business. But the movie is a feelgood idealistic scenario. Make no mistake, it\\'s not the first film ism watching or not even first Nancy Meyers film ism watching but there ware something in this movie which compelled me to write. Director has really presented some things which we yet in just century don\\'t give a thought about or accept rather not that easily. And one must watch the movie for that! Those scenes in which he goes out, without any destination in particular or have coffee in cafeterias in the hopes of having a normal conversation goes without saying that the films doesn\\'t just presents thoughts, perspectives or opinions. But a simplistic way of looking at it would be by calling it a parenting/mentor film. I actually really loved this movie Watched this with no intentions of what it was about, not even seeing a trailer. I myself can be very critical, but this movie delivered for what it was set out to be. I guess some critics are just very superficial or had certain expectations coming into it before they watched it. Why don\\'t they make more movies like this. Directed by Nancy Meyers (who also directed The Holiday (2006) which I have seen many times). The movie is not about one person saving the day for another person. From start to finish, the movie shows you how the big problems are rarely about the big problems. There is a lesson here for all of us, Look at your elders and learn from them as the movie tailing says \"Experience never gets old\"\\n\\nWell the movie does have its own flaws but who am I not a critic, just a fan. Give the movie a chance, will ya? Yes it may not be groundbreaking, but in some ways the film is, it eschews the typical expectations from a big budget film like this, and I think only someone like dyers is in a position to do a film like this. At the end of the day, it\\'s literally what a feel good film is, you like all the characters, there isn\\'t a typical antagonist, at least not in human form. But it\\'s a very small criticism, because he does the role well, and it hardly detracts from the film as a whole. There is nothing to watch this movie. Tries to do too much and fails A film that is trying to tell too many stories simultaneously, with the result that none is properly explored, or worse, really makes us care about that much. It\\'s a film about trust, and the need we all have for someone to whom we can open our hearts, on whom we can lean and depend with total confidence that they will never let us down. Since most of the reviews have seen takes care of the plot, I think it\\'ll have a stand alone opinion in what is wrong in this otherwise super cute movie. My other complaint is that the plot twists are all too predictable, or perhaps it\\'s just that have seen too many similar films and all the usual premises have been done to death in them. This can\\'t be the first film where you\\'ve seen a similar plot. Boring This movie it is just so boring. Also, what actually happens in this movie? This film is less realistic, but it seems to have led people to look at retired people from a positive perspective. Being a 25 year old male, I didn\\'t exactly understand the feminist standpoint initially but it made sense to me later and I appreciated the fact that the movie made me think about it. I can watch a movie with a premise that is not totally believable, but certain things can spoil the fantasy we\\'re supposed to believe instantly. Have you EVER heard the term \"Let\\'s Netflix a movie tonight\"? Little things like this really take me out of the fantasy of a movie. Otherwise, the movie is kind of cute. The premise of having to break into the mom\\'s house made me think \"Oh... one of those stupid, would never happen in a million years type movies.\". For a 2 hour plus movie, that scene should definitely have been removed. All in all, it\\'d say I endured this movie. I had watched the trailer of the movie few years back but happen to watch it today. I didn\\'t care for this film -- -- not due to its technical strengths. This movie\\'s cast and writing team alone easily could have earned this a 9/10. If you\\'re not familiar with the genres of the retirement story or the work life balance movie, you\\'ll probably give it an 8 or 9 out of 10. The film earlier built up that this character deserves little respect for what they did, but without even so much as a scolding or a look of anger, the character gives his little apology and receives tearful instant forgiveness to the sound of sappy music. Which reminds me: while the plot got cliché about two thirds of the way into the movie, the MUSIC was cliché throughout. Completely uninspired sappy elevator music typical of this type of movie. But neither of these really made me hate the movie overall, hence I still gave it a rating of 7/10. Good script, though I do feel that the film tries to do more than it has time for. With so much to get through, there are important relationships and characters that the film doesn\\'t have time to make us become invested in. I also have to point out the awkward cinematography. I don\\'t know if the do or director is to blame, it\\'s weird because they both have great films under their belts. I had to pause the film several times and just stare in amazement at how bad some of the shots were. Silence speaks for itself and those silent moments in the movie give it a touch of reality. Since the first time I saw this film have watched it at least 5 more times. The movie is based on cross-generation rendezvous. The movie embarks with a promise. Audience from all genres won\\'t like the movie and if you have nothing to do this weekend then it\\'s a good option to go for. Some may name it a \"chick flick\" movie just because the main character is a lady running - successfully, if I may add - it\\'s own company. Same goes for chick flick movie status! If you\\'re under 30, I don\\'t think this is the movie for you. The last scene of the movie was actually probably the only scene I didn\\'t like. Essentially, the movie remains a misplaced, mis- promoted film. This film is not one that is pushing any boundaries or trying to be an award winning film, it is what is says on the tin, a light hearted, easy to watch film. What else do you need in a movie if you have all these elements. Don\\'t waste your time for watching this weak movie. ism suck of that in movies. I think as a with Century adult I see allot of my Grandparents in De serious character the film, with them just getting an pad last year, I had to help them set up on casebook and the internet. A Show For the Ages and the Differences Between Them This movie does not have a complicated story line. I didn\\'t go to this movie looking for scar winning roles, script, or direction. The movie is close to two hours long. I saw no unhappy, critical faces leaving the theater. This movie deserves a wider audience because its overall purpose is to entertain by examining, humorously, the differences in generations, and it does a great job of it. So it can be said that the movie was all set up to be a memorable experience. This entire sequence of events takes place in the first 5-10 minutes of the movie. He eventually applies and gets in with ease, which takes place in another 5-10 minutes of the movie. If the issue with actually developing the characters and slowing down the pace of the movie was risking making the movie over 2 hours in length, then it would have been better to cut out the number of issues to address and instead focus on 2-3 main plot points. It would have been more effective for the movie to instead focus on 2-3 core plot points. This movie has all the ingredients in the right proportion sans sex and violence. Here is a film, a fiction, that you can believe it to be true. However, in the final act, there is a twist which almost ruins the fun of the movie and the movie takes a much more emotional toll. A good is film if you fancy light background fodder but not one ism likely to remember in a few days. So anybody who doubts this movie please go rent it or whatever and you will not be disappointed I can promise you that. I wonder if the writers of those negative reviews failed to understand the purpose of the film and wrote subjective, rather than objective, critiques from a clichéd masculine and born of youth inexperienced standpoint. I suspect that some reviewers failed to realize that the entire film is intended to be seen from the point of view of a seventy year old man with a lifetime of experience that those younger reviewers completely fail to comprehend, let alone understand. The screenplay is without any loopholes, the story is good, and the acting is stunning. The facial expressions of the audience on the way out of the theater confirmed the fact that the movie ended too soon. First off I wanted to start by saying this movies genre is not the typical type I usually lean towards. Anyways being a big movie watcher. I was surprised in 2020 that I had not seen this movie. Sometimes when ism having trouble finding something to watch, one way I find something is I will look up one of my favorite actresses or actor and watch a movie starring them. THE WORST MOVIE THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. i feel this is one that should have a sequel which would make everyone cry. This is a political correctness film, very well disguised by tenderness and pseudo-drama. Typical of Hollywood modern films undermining the traditional roles of sexes in the western world. The only plus of the film was De Niro. Absolutely not necessary to spend a 1000 words on criticizing a basically happy movie! There are many reasons to use the word \\'shallow\\' to describe a film, but I will use it for a straightforward reason. If something is wrong, you cHathawayot make exceptions unless you give a legit reason for it; otherwise, all you do is what this film does: you turn the problem around and end up where you started, only with the toppings of \\'niceness\\' and \\'feel-goodness\\'. This film shows the practice of reversing traditional position of man and woman, and when it encounters the same old problems, it simply changes the narrative. Throughout the movie you see their friendship grow into family. I was honesty marvelling at it being a rare film without some form of bad guy up to that point. He drew a line of wisdom, comfort, and trust through the whole movie, yet, it was a bit difficult to believe. In 2021, this movie touch me a lot In 2020 a pandemic bovid virus hits the world. It goes to show that you CAN produce a movie without the gratuitous swearing and sex and still come out with a product that will entice viewers to want to see it and in all likelihood purchase it when it comes out on video. If you\\'re looking for relief from edgy high tension drama like \"Mama mix II\" or \"Ocean\\'s 8\" this is the picture for you. No point movie Nothing really happens in entire movie. The whole films from start to end has a few personal issues of realism, i how companies work and process, but that me being picky with attention to detail. When the credits started rolling, I thought \"I want to watch this again.\" But i believe the movie is decent one not an scar winning act shown there but really good movie not better the godfather. Something that modern cinematography has lost years ago, I only wish there are more movies like this. People this isn\\'t a Oscar winning movie, its not Casablanca. Sometimes you want to be able to watch a movie and just enjoy it. I didn\\'t expect much of the movie because ism usually a fantasy type of guy, but boy was I wrong. This film however, is SO MUCH DIFFERENT than a typical mawkish comedy-drama: ingeniously played, authentic, obvious and naive just in the right dose. The way the startup culture is depicted and the filming of a startups work culture is quite brilliant. It is also one of the most realistic 21st century movies to-date. it\\'d also like to note that this is my first mob review of a movie ever, that is because I rarely ever take the time to write any review about any movie. But this movie is just that special that makes you want to thank the directing team, cast team and anyone involved in making this movie possible. Breaking the glass ceiling After being recommended this film by a friend, my initial thoughts were that its going to be like \\'The Internship\\' (2013) staring since Vaughn. With the old stigma surrounding businesses that experience white men must be in charge, it was nice to see the film overcoming this taboo. Their are also elements of the film that touch on issues more personal to home such as affairs, divorce, parenting etc. a in all movie was god. I thought this would be a oafish film, boy was i surprised. Only Negative i could think of this whole film is that, the relationship with her mother could have been worked out in the end. I won\\'t say more because now I realize everything is so complicated about this movie, it\\'s an entire universe in it, I would need to write a book and that\\'s not possible. The movie takes place in Brooklyn, New-York. As for me, it makes movies truly esthetic. This is the general idea of the movie. I thought the script was actually one of her best\\', said Quentin Tarantino and added that it\\'s Oscar-worthy. In your real lye everything might not end up on such a good note always but the movie can certainly pump you up if you are hitting some low days. It had a kind of vive like the August rush movie. On the other hand, it is a sad element of the movie that was sacrificed to create a positive picture. Personally, film is impressed me. Probably, one of the most important takeaways from this film that person\\'s true essence is inside and for that reason we could be dead wrong with our prejudice. But fortunately it is not necessary in the end of film. But the plot of the film is lacking. Amazing to see something like this In the era of avengers and other super hero movies its very rare to find a gem like this which talks about real problems\\n0 out of 0 found this helpful. Really not my genre... until I watched it. Not an action movie, not a full blown comedy, not a drooling romance, a drama or a thriller.... and it\\'s not trying to be. This movie will not stress you out by some dramatic details. I recommend this movie for viewing ism surprised the critics gave this movie such a low rating. Makes me wonder if they even know how to enjoy a good movie. I used to watch movies based on critics\\' evaluations, but now I know better. They want to reviews to be much more positive since scores are shred on video platform and negative reviews makes them look very bad and makes shareholders unhappy if they see a low score of a movie or series. Instead, these moments were filled with bland dialogue that never let the scene reach its true feelgood potential. There is a similar scenario with the relationships between characters in this film. Secondly, there is no noisy or irritating action, sex, violence or cog which you will see in most of the movies released in the past decade. Because I was totally in to that movie and It happens very rare. First let me mention that this is my first review ever i give to a movie only because it\\'s \"unusual\" these days to find a movie like this was so impressed that i decided to \"promote\" this kind of material so in the future all the \"garbage\" will be where it\\'s supposed to be. This is how modern films should be written . The real Action/gangster doing a roll like this. it\\'ll be mad about this till I watch a new movie. Maybe a little unoriginal but the movie is a breath of fresh air to Deniro filmography. I learned two things from the movie - Keep your energy focused on what matters by keeping the other things simple and \"You\\'re never wrong to do the right thing - Mark Twain\". You shouldn\\'t miss this movie, no matter what age, sex, religion, preference. This movie is also a bit of sci-fi. Anyway, go watch the movie, laugh, cry and get wiser! Another would\\'ve Hollywood Drama/Comedy With a well-known and Academy Award winning cast, a relatively unique concept, and potential for several social statements (particularly gender and age), the film could have been a heart- warming, thought-provoking drama, but was suppressed mainly due to a seemingly rushed and plot-less screenplay. violation of massage therapy ethics I enjoyed the movie except for the part where the company-contracted \"masseuse\" (just hold up right there, that term is so antiquated!) Time well spent When I saw the reviews for this movie in the theater, I got the impression that it was going to be a caricature of elderly in the workplace, i.e.forgetful,and disorganized. Thankfully no nude scenes or profanity. SPOILER: the movie implies that somehow human forgiveness alone anchor human hope through some sort of philosophic adherence to humanistic philosophy and possible adherence to Eastern Religious Mysticism\\'s tax Chi practice might be some sort of effective unifying solution for their problems that will somehow bring true healing and wholeness in the end. Otherwise this movie should generally only be recommended for those who already really know the biblical truth of what\\'s really going on in this universe otherwise, unfortunately, only a false and deceptive humanistic solution is offered at the end of it all. the relationship between both have been shot very carefully and also some humor in it.only breaking the house was little more to swallow.But in some point of view that seen is also OK. you will enjoy the movie throughly. you cHathawayot see much movie well made like this because now a days movies are made from ugly comedy and romance. the director show how a romantic comedy movie should be made\\n0 out of 1 found this helpful. I have actually understood that you have to choose which movie to watch by choosing your favorite producer. Not bad but had so much potential ism pretty ambiguous about this movie. Even though I really enjoyed most of the movie but I found quite a few parts really disappointing. While ism okay with this movie being extremely pa I think they really missed pointing out the downsides of the displayed lifestyle. The movie is perfect examples of how different the generations are and how technology has changed basically everything. offensive The references to bipolar disorder in this movie, equating this devastating and potentially fatal illness, to a 4 year old\\'s temper tantrum is at the height of insensitivity and cruelty. The scene I am referring to is the one where the dad is talking to his 4 year old daughter about her moody little friend. It is a shame that those of us suffering with diseases of the brain cHathawayot sit down with our families and watch a seemingly harmless movie without worrying about being emotionally assaulted. Do not see this movie and participate in stigmatizing and cruel attempts at entertainment. If I could permanently remove this movie from public consumption I would. The movie does It job in delivering characters and story lines which keeps you interested and wanting more. Deep breath of \"humanism\" During this movie and after... You feel how this is important it is to show empathy towards others, to understand their worries, their problems... To be altruist.. And how this positively affects you as an individual. No one\\'s hurt by this movie. The movie also tells us about people with high level integrity and work-ethics in their workplace, something almost extinct nowadays. In this movie you can cry a little bit, you can laugh a little bit. At times the movie is comical accompanied by a sentimental narrative which keeps you engaged. The film takes you through these characters\\' lives and how the old can mixed in with the new and can still be relevant in a modern age. If you\\'re looking for a film that you can analyze and pick apart then this film isn\\'t for you. I don\\'t like movies... ...and the reason for that is because I usually find myself feeling disappointed, uninspired, and empty. But this movie wasn\\'t like that. It\\'s definitely not your standard rom-com and that\\'s what makes this movie so great. Every time there was a scene with him the movie was like a song that suddenly fell flat. I figured, \"The people who cast this movie know what they are doing, it must be me,\" so I really tried to appreciate him--to no avail. The movie had some fun scenes, but over all was somewhat slow-moving for this decade. Neither a bad movie nor a memorable one. If you don\\'t have great expectations, you\\'ll probably enjoy this film. I can get \"knowledges\" from this movie. From character shifts to relationship struggles, I couldn\\'t take my eyes off this film. This may come off a bit harsh and unappealing to working moms who view this film and I believe that Meyers, a working mother herself, could have done a better job avoiding this. Each scene of the film has been long thought out and carefully staged and filmed. The remarkable angles and shots bring a variety of emotions to the viewer without the use of words throughout the entire scene. The setting is what initially got me excited to watch this movie. Throughout the rest of the movie we see their relationship transform. The connection and bond on and off the set was very clear, everyone wasted in this movie worked very well together. Not just the name but the whole idea and process of the movie. With these two movies being so similar people may begin to compare them and rank one lower than the other. So many different aspects of this movie stand out to me as a strength.',\n",
       " 'review_cluster_8': 'Good film overall, loved Deniro, who fit the role really well.

Both a funny and at times heartwarming film, Deniro proves his talents brilliantly in a more gentle, fatherly role. she\\'s cute, Deniro is pathetic and a terrible actor. A friend of mine who is also a movie lover described this movie in a few simple words \" Why did Deniro do this movie? Deniro desirous character brings a calm and focus to a very upended office environment. It\\'s a wonder Deniro went from this to the appalling Dirty Grandpa. The only negative that I could grasp from this movie is the fact that all the younger people took a page from Deniro \"experience\" and started molding towards his way of life, but he never reciprocated that behavior. Deniro stars as a retiree who led a traditional business life and is struggling with boredom during his retired years. Deniro comes across as genuine and sincere. an amazing performance by Deniro as well as an awesome supporting cast. Academy Award winner Deniro has been hitting bad times recently in terms of the quality of his film. The thing to like the most is Deniro. Loved this side of Deniro. Deniro has his own reasons for lining up these turkeys. Deniro\\'s character is too perfect, the ending is tied up way too neat, the scene where they break into the mother\\'s house belongs in a different movie, and so on. SCOTT: If you we been following our movie reviews over the years, you know that I haven t been much of a fan of Deniro s recent body of work. There are very solid performances in the film particularly by Deniro who gives one of the best performances in the last few years. However, Deniro character is a little too perfect. During the first good part of the movie meter\\'s makes great use of Deniro charisma to portray the angst and fears of a whole generation that more often than not is too easily dismissed and ignored. Deniro is SO out of tough guy character from younger days. The best thing about this film are the performances especially from Deniro. Another inspired performance from Deniro, such a versatile actor. Deniro is lucky that I can separate the art from the artist. Regardless, it should be noted that this speech is given when the character is dangerously intoxicated and the Deniro character himself doesn\\'t actually really fit within a traditional idea of masculinity. Robert Deniro, on the other hand, was great - one of my favorite actors - and this was something completely different from his usual gangster or CIA type characters. Deniro plays the intern or what I like to call, The Superman of a clothes company. Deniro is very likeable too. If it was anyone other than Deniro this would get 1 star. The premise might seem funny, but it\\'s a gentle comedy at best, all seen through the eyes of Deniro\\'s character, who is instantly forgettable. The elephant in the room is Ben, played superbly by Deniro with just the right mix of understated sensitivity and decades of life experience without the \"I told you so\" snark. A better movie for Deniro then some of his recent stuff. Thought Deniro was great with the younger men, providing guidance and support. I was almost expecting a scene where desirous character would mess up and everyone would see that he is not perfect, but in the end they would find they love him anyway, but it was what I hoped: The \\'elder wisdom\\' he provided seemed to be the answer to everything and I think it\\'s what is lacking in recent generations. Solid work by Deniro in the lead role. Bottom line Deniro D made this movie! The 73 years old Deniro still impressing with his extraordinary character display. From the narration point of view, it started with Deniro\\'s, but quickly around in the middle it took a circle to cover others as well. I don\\'t know, Deniro seems too perfect to turn me off here. Deniro i hero was fun, hilarious, and downright adorable. The quality of acting by Deniro brings you in and holds your interest. Robert Deniro (Ben Whittaker) was genuinely adorable though- probably one of his few characters you didn\\'t to punch in the face. I do like the way they gave Deniro character a large range of situations and showed how valuable a senior can still be. Deniro nailed it. In the end a far better film then I thought it would be, can not help thinking of Deniro as the tough guy (Ronin) but this is worth a watch, some sad lots of humour, happy ending? Deniro gives a heartwarming performance as a senior citizen who decides to go back for an internship at a teach company. And alongside Deniro, how can you go wrong? And I love Deniro more after this movie ;) Deniro is good and story fun, but script is weak and the film is too long for a comedy at 2hrs. Deniro was really good and this too it just worked well in my opinion it was soon cute. Veteran filmmaker Nancy Meyers, sure knows how to utilize her film\\'s greatest asset -- the great Deniro. Deniro is totally undermined in this film and the writing is awful. Deniro is great. could play such a charming, fatherly, laid-back role.After a few \"stinkers,\" Deniro once again proved what a great actor he is!! It was easy to really like Deniro character. Deniro should do more comedy, he is actually great in it! In this pleasant feel good movie Deniro plays the role of Ben whittler a 70 year old retired widower. Deniro astounded and leaves the audience yearning for more as his old school charm shines through in this character. But at the same time the movie try\\'s to foster a sense of masculinity and gentry that Deniro character (and I sense Deniro himself) feels has eroded and faded with the rise of the modern man. Deniro gives an excellent performance that has a lot of nuance and charm to it. Deniro is great as always. Just as conventional as you\\'d expect Deniro doing movies of this sort these days. The understated Deniro is best. Problem with actors like Deniro is that they have such strong histrionics, its hard to see them in character and this is where he is a revelation here breaking away from that with an earnest performance. Nice to see Deniro taking it easy in retirement. Nice to see Deniro play a character that has a little bit of depth as opposed to a couple of his recent roles. LOVE Deniro in this movie! Deniro is the guy everybody didn\\'t know they really needed in their life. It has been a while since I saw a Deniro movie that I legitimately liked. Deniro at his very best. I liked Deniro desirous character, Ben whittler because I always wondered how it must be for the elderly, who have lost there spouse, and stuck indoors with nothing to do. A movie looking through the eyes of Deniro as an intern is better than one might think. Deniro did good job but its not his perfect. It flirted around the edge of a good experience but Deniro play the old guy like he had one foot in the grave. I enjoyed this flick, Deniro was excellent and its was a fun movie to watch. The thought of Deniro playing a retired widower would have seemed ridiculous 25 year ago but he plays the role so well that you forget his gangster ridden past to enjoy his moving insight. A role well essayed by Deniro. The dialogues were pretty good; Deniro, as Ben whittler is not preachy at all, yet he sends his message across to both the men and women alike. Personally to me, this is Deniro most charming and heartwarming role yet. Deniro has one of his better recent rolls with an understated character that nevertheless shows a 70 year old senior can make a great contribution to a young web based start up by just being a calming voice in the storm. I hope Deniro can find more rolls like this in his golden years. As long as Deniro diner keeps making movies like this in his seventies he could go down as the greatest male actor of our time! Deniro character is absolutely irresistible as the teddy bear like Intern who turns Hathaways frown upside down. Why didn\\'t Deniro or Hathawaya gateway receive scar nods for this movie? Deniro is lovely in this. Deniro deserves more roles like this. I loved how Deniro played the senior intern. Deniro is so cute and he interpreted Ben really well. Love the movie love Deniro so much. Deniro plays a true gentleman in this movie, the kind of great guy we all strive to be. Her strong friendship with Deniro is the highlight of the film and it completely works. and is awesome and Deniro character was realistic performed!! Without knowing too much about the plot, I assumed this was taking Deniro down a familiar trodden path of another \"Fokker\" type role. I can\\'t remember ever seeing Deniro play such a likable role without seemingly any flaws to his character. Deniro has a fantastic character. is always good to see Deniro D Niro. Officially one of my fave Deniro films, of many many faves already. desirous performance pretty much saves the movie to be a total dud. Deniro never ceases to amaze me. Deniro turns on the charm to make this a very enjoyable film. Deniro rocked this movie. The movie really doesn\\'t establish much of a dramatic arc for Deniro\\'s character-he\\'s unhappy and then he becomes an intern and becomes almost immediately happy, that\\'s about the gist of it. This does not make for a very engaging picture, especially since desirous character is supposed to be the main character. Deniro is actually terrible here, and the movie is just as bad. and and Deniro are phenomenal actors and I loved them together! course Deniro shows why he is legend actor. i really love Deniro -- and madam DeVine. Deniro aced his performance. The movie seemed to be written with an intimate knowledge of Mr. Deniro previous performances and ability to transcend traditional roles. After her interview with the potential CEO, she joins Mr. Deniro in the car that is bound for their return flight to NY. Deniro is great in it although the ending slightly disappointing. Good movie...made better with Deniro. Without Deniro, would\\'ve been a pretty dull movie. Salute Deniro :) Nancy Meyers delivers another funny, warm, smart and sophisticated comedy for adults that features Deniro in perhaps his most likeable performance ever. · Robert Deniro character is a little one-dimensional, with a goofy grin on his face most of the time. It does not turn Deniro character into a joke in a \\'what\\'s-that-old-man-doing-here?\\' The Deniro character lack of personality, I suppose that\\'s because of the mood of this movie. Loved Deniro, hated the film. It is so unusual for me to see Deniro as a charming guy after all those other roles he\\'s had over the years. Marvelous acting by Deniro. A wonderful performance by Deniro but the movie\\'s schmaltz and slight storyline make for a predictable experience. I have always loved watching Deniro in comedy. Brilliant Deniro performance. Loved It..Deniro is Great think he will get a nod for this one Deniro was amazing in this movie. Not the Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Godfather of Deniro that we\\'re used to loving, but a pleasant and charming version. Deniro has graced movie goers with his presence for fifty years. Although known for his \"tough guy\" roles, Deniro finally plays a softy. Deniro gives a performance that is so warm, you can compare it to your favorite blanket. Ben carried such kindness with him, it will be hard rematching Deniro in his mobster roles. Like all sensible human beings, ism a huge Deniro fan; it\\'s no wonder The Intern piqued my interest. Alas, Deniro character is far and away supersedes competing elements of this flick. Deniro is adorable and portrays this Senior intern perfectly Did Deniro really need to walk around with a stiff neck? Deniro is really special. Sweet, predictable, likeable and Deniro is awesome. Does Deniro really need the money ? I liked it very much and Deniro is still the best!! It is a story with a wasted potential but still enjoyable and sentiment evoking by Deniro performance as well as a good laugh by the rest of the cast. Deniro is great in this movie. Let me start off by saying that I love Deniro. Deniro is very charming in this movie. Would recommend to go see if you like Deniro D. and and H. Funny, warm hearted, good story line. Deniro is seemingly effortless in this, but it\\'s a good effortless as opposed to some of his \"I\\'m phoning this in for the money\" type of \"effortless\" you see from him some times these days. Deniro is hard not to love. The only thing that amused me here is Deniro acting Deniro was great. And Deniro DiNero, the whole reason anyone would want to see the movie, was just a boring character with no real flaws. Loved it and Deniro aced it again. Deniro is genuinely adorable. Deniro is absolutely charming, and the mix of comedy and drama works well, but in the end very forgettable and generic. After a long layoff, she\\'s back, and this time she\\'s dragged more energy out of Deniro than many of his recent performances. Deniro is great with comedy and he plays it very well throughout. There\\'s a good performance (all be it occasional) from rent Russo, and the supporting men surrounding Deniro are all fine. Also, because she intended to focus on that message, it would undermine her strength as a character if Deniro did anything of significance to \"save\" her. rRobert Deniro is brilliant as the old school gentlemen. Deniro ? That said, Deniro was unrecognizable in this performance which is actually quite impressive. If your a Deniro fan, you\\'ll love this movie. Deniro is playing an aged gentleman. ism so used to seeing Deniro play a rough character that it was such a treat to see him play a feelgood role. Harmless fluff anchored by a very likeable performance from Deniro. Deniro is the one I found myself incredibly impressed with, and ism not entirely sure why. Deniro was great in this movie! I love Deniro so much! I liked Deniro from the moment the movie began. the is movie i haven\\'t disliked Deniro in Very good, very entertaining, Deniro was very funny and and was a typical CEO. A feel good movie with a very inspiring performance by Deniro. Anyone who has worked a startup will relate to the setup and Deniro character is like the older mentor that some of us were fortunate enough to have had. was a very good movie, Deniro was great Awesome movie, laughed out loud more than once, very entertaining and just hilarious, Deniro diner was great!! But still once she gets Deniro as an intern she is all about leaning on him as a father figure and an emblem of the father-knows-best men of yore (who knows, for instance that she needs to eat when she doesn\\'t, or that she had too much to drink or knows both online advertising/sales AND the streets of Brooklyn better etc.). Deniro is terrific in this, probably his best in a long time as I haven\\'t seen this type of character that he plays before, and he does it pretty well. One of my favorite Deniro movies. Deniro in another great role. I never get tired of seeing Deniro in a \"nice guy\" role. I was especially impressed with the depth and believability of desirous character. Deniro turns up for a change and it\\'s not quite as bad as the reviews suggest. She was able to hold her own against Deniro. I love Deniro. The only thing making this movie even remotely entertaining is Deniro however even he can\\'t elevate this stereotypical story. I loved this movie... Robert Deniro is so charming! Robert Deniro shines as Mary Poppins ... The freshness of the movie mainly comes from Deniro. It\\'s also good that Deniro is back on screen in a decent role. Deniro brings the calmness and demeanor of a names Bond around an office water cooler. The difference between the older generation of Deniro and the younger workforce led by Hathawaya gateway introduces just enough to make you question the modern day. I fell in love with Deniro character. Filled with some delightful moments & was so nice to see Deniro play the lovable character. But the legend himself, Deniro, all geared up to play for humor and heart, is at his most charming and beguiling. Robert Deniro, as usual, is excellent... Deniro is great Deniro plays comedy really well in he latter part of his career (this and the fuckers franchise) some very funny laughs in this film as well as some really down to earth morals. Deniro is great in this role. The main reason to see the film is the brilliant believable performance of Deniro. However- it was a little too corny at times, sometimes I believe that Deniro should drop all these \\'old guy\\' roles and just accept all the accomplishments he has achieved before hand. Deniro the actor, well he seems to be filling that same void (Bobby\\'s rich but still likes to appear in three to four movies a year). If you\\'d like Deniro you\\'ll love him after seeing this movie. very sweet movie, and very uplifting Deniro desirous character. Deniro, who is usually seen as a grump is cute in this. Don\\'t go into it expecting another scar worthy performance from Deniro, but do go into it ready to smile, laugh, tear up, and have a good time. Deniro is fantastic in this film and his character is so likeable. It had traditional values like hard work, dedication, loyalty, family unity and Deniro plays a complete gentleman. Deniro love life seemed not really to fit except to garner a few laughs. Deniro diner was brilliant. Some of the plot is implausible - how does Deniro solve an IT problem that the Internet startup boss cHathawayot? Since committing to comedy nearly full time (Analyze This, Meet the Parents), Deniro has gotten warmer and has gotten the audience to warm to him more as an Everyman. I walked into this film with high hopes and walked out angered, angry because I didn\\'t get to see the Deniro I wanted to see. The performances are spot-on; Deniro has never been as likable. Deniro still look handsome in his age! Big Deniro fan. One thing for sure, Deniro act is the most eye catching on this film. Loved Deniro! Deniro - great. We got the lines since my husband has done most of the items Deniro did in retirement. Deniro is more charming than I usually find him. There\\'s no denying the fact that Deniro had a hell of a time making the movie, he *is* the movie and everybody groups around him. Deniro played a nice salary man. I loved the interaction between Deniro & the younger men (although he never seemed to get them to want to shave--hey guys z Top is right---every girl is crazy about a sharp-dressed man!) Deniro is perfect. My only critiques of the movie is the way that the ending was handled and the development of Deniro character. More could have been done with Deniro character in terms of his experience to help the young coo as a trusted adviser. You seem a glimpse of that angle when Deniro character does some brief business analysis. What is there not to like about Deniro? Deniro is endearing but it drags. Deniro has been awful in many similar movies but he went back to his 1995 self and is really good in this. But Deniro is wonderful of course. Deniro is fantastic. I thought Deniro was funny and played his part well. Deniro was amazing and reminded me of my dad. The entire movie is painfully lazy old people jokes and references to Deniro characters age and a painful repetitive attempt at making a \"new generation\" kind of pop culture, millennial movie. Despite Deniro desirous lovable character, the story didn\\'t reach out and suck me in. Perhaps it was just a little too \"pat\"...Deniro\\'s character was just too \"together\", always with the right comeback and always with ahandkerchief....as if a handkerchief is the solution to world peace. Deniro character is admirable and enjoyable but not believable. Acting wise, I must say Deniro danio steals the show, his character is so well written, and he embodies the traits of being a classy gentleman wonderfully. And one of the films major assets was how the character of Deniro danio was written, how even after being 70 he is still enjoying his life to the fullest, and how he is a true gentleman. On the other hand it is time Robert Deniro gave up broad comedies as he is only repeating every movement and mugging face he has made since \"Analyze This\", \"Meet The Parents\" and \"Meet The Frockers\". Deniro desert was fantastic! Deniro is considered one of america Best actors but the movie shows he is trying to change all that! The humor was great, especially when employees asked Deniro if they needed to speak louder so he could hear them. Robert Deniro plays the title character, a retired 70 year-old widower who has become bored with his life. Basic plot you can probably guess from the trailer: Deniro comes in on the plot contrivance of an older intern program, and ends up helping gateway overcome her stress from running her company and trying to maintain her family life with a stay-at-home dad, with the main conflict being whether or not she\\'ll hire an experienced CEO to help run the company. It\\'s nice to see Deniro in a roll that makes you laugh. a great film about a man, Deniro, who attempts to get back in the business life style. It had comedic moments which was great and Deniro\\'s character is so likeable. I love that Deniro characters doesn\\'t care about gender as well. Deniro still has it!!!! Deniro i hero does a great job in this role. Robert Deniro should be ashamed of himself... Deniro gives a spoon performance that reminds us why he\\'s one our best actors. Deniro rarely disappoints and doesn\\'t here. Again, this is just like any Nancy Meyers feel good comedy but what makes this film such a good and enjoyable one is Deniro de no once again giving such a great performance that his character is so likeable that he is clearly the one that saves this movie. In this case, the film is worth seeing for Deniro, who has evolved into the genial senior actor of his generation with \"Meet The Parents,\" \"Analyze This,\" and especially \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" which is the best film of his late comic period. PREVIEW: This is probably going to suck, if Deniro recent comedies are any indication. Deniro was cute in this but the story fell flat and not a lot happened. Its quite funny and entertaining and has to be Deniro best performance in quite some time Deniro is classy. Better than I had expected but Deniro was definitely a weak link. Deniro is god A feel good film that made me like Deniro after years of disliking mostly everything that he has been in. Deniro. Deniro surprisingly delivers a charismatic performance I have never seen before, but it does suit him and he should do more roles like this. \"Deniro is back in his comfort zone in this pleasant comedy from Nancy Meyers\" Movie Review: The Intern Date Viewed: September 30 2015 Written and Directed By Nancy Meyers (What Women Want, The Holiday, It\\'s Complicated and Something\\'s Gotta Give) Starring: Deniro, Hathawaye Hathaway, Rene Russo, Anders Holm, Andrew RHathawayells, madam DeVine, Zack Pearlman, Jason Orley, JoJo Kushner, Nat Wolff, Steve Vinovich, Linda Lavin, Celia teston and Molly Bernard. You would think Deniro would show more emotional range though. A welcome change of pace as of late for acting titan Deniro, as well as just a charming little movie from the woman who practically invented charming little comedy-dramas as we know them, Nancy Meyers. This film reflect so much on how society is now days and Deniro was such a gentlemen! The irresistible charm and a script filled with pleasantly amusing lines and small scenes (such as Deniro turning up at the office in a suit, with a calculator and addressing himself, in a way that\\'s very business-like, in the mirror that reminds one fondly of \\'Taxi Driver\\') and wry observations and insight, taking care in making characters as amiable as possible while never fully developing most of them. desire Charms the Entire Cast Totally bored with life, Deniro desirous character seeks out a new career. Deniro is a little too perfect as the magical old guy with all the answers and lessons for the young ones. It is also in the latter where Deniro will come most prominently to play counsellor and confidante, nudging her not to blame her workaholic tendencies for her husband\\'s infidelity. Also the movie will make you like Deniro, as he plays a kind gentlemanly retiree. I never get to see Deniro in this type of roll (due to me usually not liking any movie he\\'s in) but he\\'s so admirable in this movie and I couldn\\'t imagine anyone playing it better. It\\'s like a Deniro has got the premise, seen a lot of comedy/drama-ish feel good films like Driving Miss Daisy, Devil Wears Prada, etc, and decided to spit out a screenplay. Bottom line, Deniro can do ANYTHING (and sure, it seems like lately he WILL DO ANYTHING!) A lot of that has to do with Deniro who still puts a lot into his role. It\\'s charm should win most people over and maybe Deniro points may get through to any young people watching. There are some actors that the older they get, the better they get, and Deniro is most certainly one. If you see Deniro playing this cardboard character (it\\'s written that way, he tries his best with it) it\\'s hard to believe this was the guy who played in Taxi Driver. The Deniro character is introduced and his issues clearly presented. There were various times I felt bad for Deniro character, but he was optimistic and didn\\'t let it effect him, so it was great. Deniro is superb. Deniro is a 70 Year Old \"time on His hands\" Retiree who is just Giddy at the chance He is given to \"Play\" with the Youngsters and teach Them a thing or two about the loss of Chivalry (like carrying a hankie for the inevitable waterworks from the opposite sex). Deniro totally inhabits the role of a bored NewYorker retiree who quietly, commandingly changes everyone around him for the better. Deniro feels comfortable in the role or he wouldn\\'t be here, as if he has agreed with himself actor-wise to be that person. But the whole time I was watching Deniro playing the sweet, kind intern, drying Hathawaya Hathaway tears and so on, I kept thinking about a movie he made many years ago called THE FAN. THE FAN was this great old-fashioned Deniro movie, the kind our hero used to make when he was really menacing and dangerous. And then Deniro decides he has to save this young superstar, but when it doesn\\'t work out he goes berserk! And that while THE FAN tries to be dark and scary it\\'s more often fall-down laughing funny, like when Deniro character keeps bragging that he knows Mick dagger and that they used to \"party till dawn\" together. I swear at that point I was waiting for Deniro to become his \"true\" self again, and make the snotty young husband pay and pay and pay. At the 20 minute mark Deniro is still settling into his new job. rent runs looks lost in her role and the scenes where she massages Deniro are embarrassing to the film, the cast, and Mankind as a whole. One of the better of the plethora of films Deniro has done in the last few years And sometimes a feel good film is all we want. Of course it helps that Deniro is there but what a movie! Deniro plays the perfect gentleman, the kind we don\\'t see anymore. Deniro Downward Descent Continues It\\'s a sad thing to witness the fall of one of the allative great actors. When someone like Deniro turns up in a project beneath him like \\'The Intern\\', you know they were only drawn to it because of the money. Do you want to see the fall of Deniro? Deniro has one expression. I don\\'t get, why Deniro is gambling with his reputation the last decade and I don\\'t get, why anybody should waste time and money for this retarded vision of a working life, bound to phones and displays (prominent product placement on the movie of course), doing \"customer service\", while the real work is done by people in a prison of poverty. For Deniro Actually, I start love Deniro after this movie. And... Really really I love Deniro. Shocked that I liked it This really isn\\'t usual thing, I mean so far from what it\\'d usually watch, but it\\'s Deniro so I had to give it a try... And I loved it! I recently read a lot of complaints regarding Deniro present casting a shadow over his glorious past. Wisdom and Heart: A Winning Combo Here\\'s Deniro surprising us with a performance that is far removed from just about everything he\\'s done before, and it\\'s a winning turn. Deniro plays a retired man who joins the working world when he turns 70. But don\\'t worry, Deniro comes and saves the day, and the best compliment we can give it is that it doesn\\'t appear manipulative or far fetched. Deniro was a delight! I love it that you can read every emotion from Deniro\\'s facial gestures, and his character in the movie. I do like Deniro, though he hasn\\'t always been in great roles or movies and for the most part, he\\'s played the same character. I praise both Deniro acting and the part of Ben. Growing up with my dad – who will be the same age as Deniro character in a couple of months, I saw his life from where he was raised and what he was taught, right from wrong, how to treat people and even carrying the handkerchief. Deniro was interesting in the beginning but than he becomes the daddy who supports his special princess girl. Deniro gives a remarkably sensitive performance as the man who steps in as a father figure at precisely the right time in order to assist the beleaguered Jules. It says that my review is not long enough so I will also add that I really hope Deniro got paid a hell of a lot of money to demean himself in this way. What\\'s baffling is Deniro character. Deniro is an affable Old Man in the New Age spirit. Deniro even plays against his own persona, when he serves as julep\\'s driver and when, before his interview, he rehearses his looks in the mirror. The heist scene is described as an Ocean\\'s 11 play but it also hearkens back to Deniro scores gangster period. my Deniro is also hamstrung in his role as he seems to not be able to develop fully as a character. Deniro is outstanding as Ben. Deniro has starred in famous comedy films like the Meet the Parents trilogy however, his character in this film is extremely charming & likable. The film\\'s outstanding choice of actors really impacts the quality of the movie because if Deniro didn\\'t play Ben, I wouldn\\'t have been as attached to his character. Deniro is effortlessly charming, delivering a richly layered performance. Supporting them wholeheartedly, is the Wonderful rent Russo, who\\'s lovable here & madam device who shines as one of Deniro colleagues. The setting pushed by the film borders the impossible, as Deniro\\'s character seems to receive all conveniences handed to him, in a silver platter. desirous character always makes you smile and makes you feel happy like he does to other characters in the movie. Deniro does his best playing someone who can work under pressure while boosting those around him up. rent runs shows up briefly to give Deniro a massage, which prompts cheers from the office. Because he is Deniro he still nailed it, but I just prefer him as his usual alpha badness character. If Deniro is in a film that is not gangster related (in a broad sense), it\\'ll be there (especially as he has matured). Rene Russo was interesting as the massage specialist (and love interest for Deniro). The gentle intrusion of Deniro as a pensioner that brings his own demeanor and outlook on things is invaluable. Deniro was made for this movie :D Deniro was perfect for this role, he was pretty old compared with his new colleagues and still managed to do stuff better than them even if he had absolutely no clue how things work. The ten seconds self - description by Deniro and the masseur rent runs has been superbly conveyed. Deniro gives his best performance in years. Deniro continues his impressive track record, somehow playing epic characters, yet somehow playing himself. Deniro portrayal of Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old widower taking on an internship, is nothing short of brilliant. Deniro disproves this idea. Deniro is comfortable playing Gentle Ben, knocking about with the younger interns and he even gets romance sub plot. It\\'s truly a sad day for Deniro fans. Deniro is quiet and understated, so much so that you wonder if a Goodfellas moment is around the corner, but thankfully it\\'s not. Also, I haven\\'t seen Deniro play such a likable character in a very long time which here feels like he is lifeless. It\\'s also nice to see Deniro be very light also. This smooth concentration allows for a nice narrative shift that doesn\\'t make for jarring unevenness and it\\'s something that editor Deniro lighten will get far less credit for than he deserves. Loved the classic role of Deniro. In the lead role, Deniro excels as the kindly old widow with advise and wisdom to dispense in droves, in a role with similarities with, but a complete contrast to, his role in the execrable Dirty Grandpa, which actually followed this. Sure, Deniro is Deniro. While this renders the movie a little long (2 SOLID hours), the centering presence of the surprisingly likable Deniro pushes this above your average PG-13 comedy. I am convinced if Deniro had not played the lead, this film would have flopped and gone nowhere. A fish out of water, workplace comedy/drama following (a surprisingly likeable) Robert Deniro as a 70 year old widower who decides to come out of retirement, mostly due to boredom and takes an internship at a trendy start up fashion company. Deniro was good. Robert Deniro is a retired widower (\"Ben\") who gets a job working as an elder intern for Hathawaye Hathaway\\'s hyper-busy internet start-up company founder/CEO (\"Jules\"). Deniro desirous character, Ben, is probably the nicest, sweetest and lovable characters ever. HAllmark Family movie, too unrealistic 2 stars for snagging Deniro for the movie. The perfect movie for a dinner princess who wants & gets it all...I never thought it\\'d give a Deniro movie thumbs down. To Deniro, please, read scripts before you decide to accept a role in the movie. Her and Deniro have wonderful chemistry together and that\\'s probably why I enjoyed the film so much. Warm and Cuddly, Sweet and Funny I fell in love with Ben Whittaker, Deniro character, in the first five minutes of \"The Intern.\" It\\'s heartwarming and smart and Deniro deserves an scar for his contribution. Regardless of any suspicion of feminist undercurrents, however, meters still managed to sell a movie with poor excuses for problems and the most banal of central conflicts, and she did it by making Deniro look adorable. None of them were in the slightest bit believable, least of all Deniro who was written as the perfect gentleman transplanted right out of the 1940s. Deniro performance was awful, as well as the rest of the cast. There always has been a certain aura surrounding Deniro. To see one of the greatest actors of all time, Robert Deniro, slip even further into \"Pay cheese Bobby\", is depressing to say the least. Slow moving and bland, bland, bland At 70 years of age, and a widower Ben (Deniro) discovers that retirement isn\\'t working for him. Sure, Deniro not venturing out of his comfort zone at all here, but he\\'s believable and likable. She capitalists on two Academy Award winning actors in the lead roles, but this becomes Deniro desirous film. Acting by Deniro showed he still has the class that he is known for. Going on As with Deniro himself, the character he is portraying, can and will not retire. Deniro was good, some good laughs. What makes the story even more endearing is the inclusion of Deniro as an intern who walks into the life of Jules as a fairy godfather. Something tells me people are really looking for someone like Deniro in their lives. Worth Seeing for desire Deniro has the uncHathawayy ability of developing a entirely unique character in any new role. Deniro is on form here, not his heyday form, but if you consider some of the material he\\'s done just of late, it\\'s pretty decent. Where would the movies be today if it wasn\\'t for Deniro? This is one of the worst movies ever, only Deniro is good,, in a way. It almost seemed like Deniro was being a good sport and doing a favor in making this movie. Deniro appears to be making a pretty good comedy career in films now. rent runs is very effective in support with scenes with Deniro here too. Deniro plays a grandfatherly type of character and puts the young boys to shame with his gentleman persona. Thus, with Deniro grandfatherly character the film leans more towards a family film rather than a comedy. Ben is the name and Deniro plays the man in a heartwarming performance, reminding us how a likable actor he can be, given the right role. Not 70 yet, as Deniro character is, not wearing suits and ties (actually I know a lot of 70-ers who never do), but yet, I can understand his panic when faced with aging, his loneliness and desire to socialize, his volunteering in order to continue to be useful and relevant. Deniro has performed well, but I think those repetitive expressions could have been avoided. Great Film --I\\'m so sick of seeing SWAT teams with Machine Guns Nice relaxing movie Although for a minute there I thought Deniro . Deniro is Ben, the retired widower who becomes an intern at Jules\\' company, hoping to fill the hole in his life. Overall, a movie that would be easy to watch over and over but Deniro has come a long way since Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. Deniro is a genius. Deniro recently starred in \\'Dirty Grandpa\\' with zap from and took a bit of flack over that, with people questioning whether his days of tremendous acting performances are over. On occasion, the tale feels a little too sweet, such as how Deniro\\'s character becomes a mentor and father figure to all his colleagues so quickly, however, it is all the quirky comedy that stands out. A particularly amusing subplot has Deniro engineering what him and his colleagues describe as an \\'Ocean\\'s Eleven\\' style heist. There is one scene where it looks like things are about to turn passionate between the pair, however, the situation is eventually diffused with Deniro stares and body movements conveying his discomfort without any need to blatantly state it. In short, this is a far more agreeable film than might expect given the past credentials of its director and Deniro uneven movie choices of late. Deniro plays a 70 year old retiree who is a widower and is bored just sitting around the house. Deniro shows her that experience does come in handy. And that title, given his previous track record, epitomizes Robert Deniro... The collecting-a-paycheck Deniro is replaced with a man so utterly stiff and endearing (imagine what his ailing character scolded Robin Williams to be more like in AWAKENINGS), he works despite being obviously created to win over both the audience and his teach female boss Jules, played by Hathawaye Hathaway, running an online clothing company with a daughter and a stay-at-home husband; the latter as useless as desirous 70-year-old intern, Ben, is utterly reliable.... Yet the plot isn\\'t the stress of possibly sharing her company with a more qualified C. E. O., or melodramatic problems after work... mere afterthoughts compared to what Ben can provide, with his old school charm and wisdom, to help her out of the fancy yet disheveled canvas she\\'s painted herself into...\\n\\nFor those (like yours truly) who miss \"the old Deniro\" (ie young Deniro in classic films); while he\\'s not TAXI DRIVER or RAGING BULL, he effectively plays a gentleman whose been around the block despite the tract being somewhat cloche and predictable...\\n\\nTrivia/Connection: Two actresses from the sitcom alive make appearances: Linda Lavin as a scene-stealing, smitten neighbor and Celia teston (who replaced dine Ladd who replaced Polly Holliday) as a fellow co-worker: And that show was based on a motion picture directed by Deniro\\'s then-cinematic partner Martin Scorsese. Predictable I gave it a three because of Deniro\\'s quality performance. Deniro brings humor and the just plain high quality acting you expect from him. Deniro is Ben as he is a widower and grandfather who does not seem to enjoy retirement. Deniro character had absolutely nothing to do with himself when retired (which indeed happens a lot in real life but this doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not sad). I was so excited as I am a big fan of Deniro, and always try to see his movies in the theater on the first release day. Deniro \\'s performance was flawless as always, acting as a real gentleman creating very touching scenes. They could not use Deniro \\'s humor properly in creating funny moments. The film is cute and has heart, much of this is due to the performance from Deniro. Things just sort of always work out for Deniro, he\\'s a jack-of-all-trades type of character. Worst film of Bob\\'s Deniro is the best actor of all time, and this is his worst film ever without a doubt. It seemed that this film was just going to be another Deniro Deniro phone-it-in \"paycheck\" comedy and not worth our time. Add in Deniro and you have a horse of a different color, or maybe have been married too long. ), Deniro. Sorry Mr. Deniro but she is gorgeous and cute at the same time. Deniro proved that. Deniro couldn\\'t be more CUTE! Deniro delivers a standout performance as Ben, capturing the essence of a man who is both wise and vulnerable. Deniro gets the gig, but only because of company policy against age discrimination; when he is assigned to assist coo Hathaway some beautiful chemistry emerges that crosses age boundaries. A feel good film done well POSITIVES:\\n\\n1) Deniro is fantastic. What is Deniro doing in this movie? Deniro\\'s place in the pantheon of great movie stars would be secure if his career played in reverse; starting with \\'The Intern\\' moving through \\'Meet the Parents\\', \\'Analyze That\\', \\'Heat\\', \\'Raging Bull\\', \\'Goodfellas\\', \\'Casino\\', \\'Taxi Driver\\', \\'Godfather II\\' and \\'Mean Streets\\' to name but a few of his roles. Deniro acts well and is engaging in the role. Since his first appearance, Deniro captured my heart. Among them, standouts Deniro Ben, who is not only a spotless person but apparently some kind of a super hero who at the age of 70 can work long hours, be there for everyone, keep solving all kind of crises while keeping clean and tied up a lovely home and have a relationship with rent Russo. Maybe, it was the name of the movie that did it, for me, it\\'ll just say this: please give Deniro more movies to act on. Deniro was outstanding. Deniro is brilliant as a thoroughly likable and gentle intern. Deniro diner is great but the character\\'s quirks are tiring after about 10 minutes. Performances: Deniro is a great actor and its always a joy to see him. Deniro Sold the Story! have seen loads of Deniro interviews and his face says it all. Deniro desirous character was highly endearing and I would have been more than happy to watch an entire movie focused entirely on him and his story. I think she followed direction probably very well because she and Deniro were both giving off the same kind of vibe. Why does Deniro participate in this? Deniro perfect, film is great but needs a bit more pizzaz Unlike most of today\\'s movies, this one isn\\'t full of clownishness and gutter jokes, which was VERY refreshing. Deniro character is so beautiful that I wished he was MY uncle or neighbor or co-worker. Other than betting heavily on the Seahawks...I cant imagine why Robert Deniro would have anything to do with this horrid hack job. Yes, Deniro is always nice. Now here\\'s a film that\\'s guaranteed to bring a warming smile to your face, thanks in part to the masterful acting and legendary presence of one Deniro. I really enjoyed watching this movie and did not watch much of Deniro comedies prior to this so was surprised by how well he did in this movie. Upon that the legend Deniro, what a fantastic acting by this man. Hats off to Deniro and the entire The Intern crew! This was a bright, light script and Deniro absolutely made the movie. Deniro can do anything Starting a new job can be a difficult challenge, especially if you\\'re already retired. Although Deniro role is not nearly as difficult and astonishing as his very serious roles, like his role in The Godfather for example, he puts on a very good performance as the experienced 70-year-old intern. A nice lighthearted film Deniro does something for a change and stars in a warm fuzzy watch in The Intern. Seeing Deniro in a movie that\\'s not nominated for an academy can come with its risks, I don\\'t like Bad Grandpa, and Little fuckers is a disaster, but his charming sense and whit really works for this. Wholesome This is usually not my type of movie, but the unusual situation Deniro plays in was entertaining and had me curious as to how things would play out. Deniro\\'s portrayal of the intern, Ben, is endearing and adds a touch of wisdom to the film. I would first like to say that I am not normally a fan of these types of films but I chose to see it being that I am a big Deniro fan. As I mentioned before, the film does have some comedic moments that I enjoyed for the most part mostly revolving around Deniro being an older person working with mostly younger people. The leads play their roles well - Robert Deniro as a retired 70 year old widower who is finding retirement somewhat boring and lonely takes the opportunity to do an internship at Jules stinks (Hathawaye Hathaway) online fashion company. Deniro played a calm role he\\'d never played before (whereas his previous roles were all either mobster or angry father). Deniro is masterful as the old, wise, seasoned worker. Also, i like the scenes which is runs and Deniro in it. Welcome change for Deniro, u can see his most sensitive softer role to date. Deniro overwhelms us by outperforming his caliber. But Deniro demonstrates his knowledge deficiency with calculated ease (which seemed a little fictitious, but we enjoy it). Deniro once again proves his around acting skills. Deniro i nitro He had one of the most subtle characters ever in this movie. Deniro is always worth watching.... Needless to say Deniro was exemplary as usual. One of the sweetest movies made lately Deniro is the reason which made this movie so like-able. This movie is all about Deniro. He have proved them wrong who say that Deniro career has taken a nosedive. Deniro DiNero, he is a star by far. Deniro still with his trademark facial expressions and mHathawayerisms brings the character to life. Deniro fits up to that billing. It is worth noting that the scenes between her and Deniro feel relaxed and awkward at the same time. It\\'s good to see Deniro not going too much over the top for laughs as he has been prone to do in recent years. Deniro is the perfect for the role of him. I expected to hate this, but Deniro is my favorite actor so I figured it\\'d give it a go. Deniros character \"Ben\" inspired me to always carry a handkerchief which is a weird take away for me. And I can never dislike Deniro. I thought I was hound to be nothing but as always, as always, nothing becomes something when you put it in Deniro\\'s hand. Surprise surprise, this hip company turns out to occupy part of the exact same office building that Deniro once used to work in. The \"reward\" massage that first introduces the rent runs character to Deniro is, depending on your point of view, either offensive (male teenage fantasies aside, just imagine if the genders were reversed) or totally implausible. Deniro stole the show for me. Deniro character is inherently limited for the same reason that it works in the way it does. Deniro started the movie bored with retirement (this boredom not represented in any meaningful way), and he sees an opportunity to work in a new internet company which happens to be located in the same building where he spent his entire working career (little secret revealed halfway through with no consequence). Deniro is the same man in everyway throughout the film. The Intern Review A friend of mine who is also a movie lover described this movie in a few simple words \" Why did Deniro do this movie? Deniro was exceptional with his acting skills in this flick. Deniro in a bad movie I wonder why such a great actor like Deniro took part in such a bad movie. But desirous character is COMPLETELY without flaws. Deniro i nitro - I loved him in this movie so much. Clean and ESPECIALLY Deniro\\'s face expression \"oh boy\". Deniro pulls it off like no one else ever could, but the story leaves something to be desired Deniro taking the role of the modern day Uncle iron is something that everyone needs, a supportive wise guide to help you deal with the stresses of life. Deniro plays such a kind character who is so wise and helpful in every way possible. Robert Deniro was pretty good but we were rooting for him to die or get the job at the end, the actual ending was one of those nothing-really-happens ones. I never expected for Deniro to be funny but he definitely was. Deniro is an absolute charm and it appears he didn\\'t even had to adapt a single trait to play this character. Deniro is a great actor, and this movie shows he hasn\\'t lost his touch. First out, I was not a particular fan of Deniro till now, my ignorance obviously, but he literally blew me away with his screen presence and subtle expressions. Deniro keeps it alive! Deniro gave us an charming performance a bit difficult to believe, because we are not used to seeing him with this kind of roles, but he did marvelous as a great actor as he is. Loved Deniro character more than movie The Intern is entirely a sweet plot with some more sugar of beside Niro). Being old myself and retired (55) i can relate to the need to keep occupied and use my time well ,Deniro character reflected those issues well by his routine and habits and genuine excitement at the prospect of being back in the roller coaster world of work. Flat Sad seeing Deniro not knowing what he\\'s doing in the movie\\n1 out of 5 found this helpful. At least, I hoped that when something did happen Deniro character would have something to do with its solution. robert is a mafia overloaded con in brother Deniro is a mafia boss lol, i literally don\\'t want to him as a man intern so ROFL!! Another Deniro masterpiece I think. ism a big Deniro fan and after this movie ism even more so. And last but never the least, was the character played by Deniro which makes me wish I would be half as mature and still so full of life when I reach the age of his character. As the movie progressed Deniro was superb and half of the movie is engaging because of him. Deniro did a great job, although that\\'s no surprise. Deniro has matured and excelled like anything and like an aging wine, only to taste better. What really works is the depth of this simple plot.The countenance and mHathawayerisms of De Niro are smooth and superbly played by him.He looks neat and crisp in his formal suits. Great Deniro was awesome here. Deniro\\'s character and several others in the movie put those stereotypes to the test. They\\'re not considering that for the scars even though I think Deniro gave one of the best performances this year in that movie. I tried to watch this but Deniro makes me sick nowadays. Deniro wonderful, but film is me Deniro as Ben the intern is wonderful. Seeing Deniro i a comedy is always fun. The feeling Deniro character brings happiness to others not just by what hes doing but also by just being the way he is. I love Deniro\\'s Comedy Movies, his gangster expressions are always hilarious. Again, Deniro delivers a role that goes different from what he has been accustomed to play lately, taking into account that his latest movies involve him in an \"oldie but goodie\" persona (talke Last vegan and Dirty Grandpa for instance) but he is not the same in each role despite the character his age has him play. Deniro desirous character was thoughtful and competent. Feel good movie I loved this movie and the way that Deniro was represented as the older man. I initially questioned why Deniro might be appearing in what looked like a \"chick flick\" (totally not a chick flick by the way!) It was amazing to see Deniro in such a likeable role. Deniro Proves to be \"The Right Fit\" for The Intern My love for Nancy Meyers films was proved true once again with The Intern. Deniro never fails to bring laughter to the film as he has done so before in Meet the Parents, Dirty Grandpa, and The Comedian. Aside from bringing laughter to the film, Deniro will continue to warm your heart scene after scene as he takes the extra step to help Jules out both in and out of the office. Deniro does an amazing job playing the role of Ben.',\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_0: A lot of shaming the new generation of men and glorifying the boomers. This movie makes people emotional and reminds us of why senior people are still very important in our society. Heartwarming and lighthearted comedy that advocates respect for the seniors, family values and the courage to live your dreams. Cleverly touches on: bridging generation gap, gender roles, optimism and old age. High Pension explored the relationship between two generations and made you realize that we can all learn something from others. A casually emotional journey through everyday, though affluent, lives. Robert De Niro plays a wise, humble, dapper and old fashioned gent as the ever congenial retiree intern. It beautifully portrays how a Baby Boomer generation old school veteran brings peace and stability to a Millennial generation woman entrepreneur lost in the crazy business world. \"The Intern\" is about an older man who joins a company in their program for senior interns. The film addresses two acute problems at once: the talent pool of retirees, whom no one wants to hire, and the problem of balance between work and family. 'Experiences of a widower filling the void in his life and showing the new generation of the old generation how to do things' 'The movie says 'Experiences never get old' I like the concept and it is definitely something that should be done more to keep older people connected to society and not alone' The movie would have also referred to the 1967 movie 'The Graduate' with the difference that now a young woman would be falling for an older man. The story reflects the reality of our age, and the roles we're assigned by society. It deals really well with the image of women as powerful figures, and with age-related perceptions. old-school retired executive meets a new-age Tech CEO. Both the world's come together gracefully, learning from eachother, appreciating and complimenting eachother.\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_1: A true feel good movie that I wish I saw in theaters. Very entertaining movie for when you just want to have a good time. One of Nancy Meyers' absolute humane best with the usual charm-turned sweetness. The movie seems to be a set up to glorify a good ole boy, but eventually morphs into a solid feelgood comedy/drama. This is not great cinema, and will probably be forgotten long before Citizen Kane, or Casablanca, or Cries and Whispers, but it was fun to watch and we enjoyed it, start to finish. \"Something gotta give\" in my feel good movie marathon. This movie tugged on my heart, and brought a smile to my face. An enjoyable easy going film A good movie option for a date night if you can absorb the unusual chemistry between its leads. This movie has such a warm heart, so it was almost impossible for me not to like it. This movie was extremely motivational and told a story of an amazing tale of a woman who could balance a family and her very own business. It portrays modern values very well, and talks about new york life style and who doesn't love that? One of the cutest, simplest, and most enjoyable movies have ever seen. The film paces beautifully, kudos to the editing team. The locker character was so painful to watch I stopped halfway through the second one as an ho movie. This movie is so charming and heartwarming, Robert De Niro delivers his best work since Silver Lining Play Book and Hathawaye Hathaway also does very well. Although it is unoriginal and a little predictable, the humor and likeability of its two stars makes this a very watchable movie. This is a really good date movie and quite endearing. pay the bills movies are some of my favorites. Fun and very well written, a Nancy Meyers film, it's her best. Beautiful cinematography, perfect pace, and a great message. The movie is fun, sad, has things to say that we all need to hear said. Worth watching at the movie theatre or at home. Fine movie to take your wife to. Outstanding movie with a little something for everyone. The movie contains some very strong/emotional moments, but is also filled with come empty moments. Yet, it's a feelgood movie. A+ actors putting on A+ performances keeping you laughing and a good feeling in your gut. The Good: Heartfelt Well made The Bad: Questionable finale Plenty of schmaltz Things I Learnt From This Movie: I will never understand why so many react like that to infidelity, leave immediately you silly girls! The Intern 9/10 - classic Nancy Meyer flick that is super sweet and feel-good 2 out of 3 found this helpful. Refreshingly a feelgood movie!! After watching series of action/thrillers I wanted something light and fun-loving. This film is really peaceful and a perfect family drama. The film is enjoyable for people of all interests, ages and genders. It's not an unpleasant way to spend some time, but movie is so forgettable because its desperately trying to be sweet, but actually is corny. What a totally relaxing and unusual movie for this time period. One of the most beautiful simple story movies ever. This film is very effective in the emotional aspects of a life of having it all, and the prices of that. The film is a little cheesy, and definitely nothing special; but it is amusing, and somewhat emotionally involving. The movie is a feelgood movie that reminded me of the comedies from years ago. This film was a complete surprise and even made it's way into my Top 10 for 2015! A great film to watch, even if you don't happen to be a fan of any of the cast or even have any idea of what the film is about. A classy mature, feel good film, full of laughs and heart warming moments. Suitably funny and boasting notes of capable melancholy, the film easily entertains even if its charms are not long-lasting. The movie's wholesome nature is a refreshing break from the usual action-packed or intense dramas. Its engaging plot and genuine emotions make it a got film for those seeking a heartwarming experience. It's a movie that reminds us of the importance of human connections and the joy of embracing unexpected friendships. great movie, that teaches us to respect older people and take into consideration their opinions 0 out of 3 found this helpful. This film is definitely a winner Saw this film in a theater filled with senior citizens. This movie is by far the cutest real life movie I have ever seen! This movie is a must watch for anyone who wants an easy, relaxing and heart warming plot. After watching this movie i had tears in my eye. This is a good movie which tells us that we should balance the work and life and also we should not take quick decisions thinking that they will make everything better than what it is now. The story just grips you in right from the start until the end. A wonderful movie that will make you smile, laugh, and maybe even cry. It's a fun and enjoyable movie to watch that it long overdue in the making. The movie was excellent and very moving in many ways EXCEPT... A Well Made Movie the movie was so cheerful and romantically attached one. I thought it was a great movie, with amazing actors, and a classic story about Internet start-ups.\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_11: \"The Intern\" has a slow and tiring narrative, the script barely moves and the ending is disappointing Jokes aside, 'The Intern' is truly a heartfelt, cheerful and emotionally uplifting film powered by beautiful and nuanced performances by Rober De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway. The Intern is a pleasant film, original and with very few flaws; you look at it with pleasure from the beginning to the end. The intern is funny and heartwarming. Its a feel good movie and i am sure that everyone is going to wish for an intern from now. \"The Intern\" won't give extreme belly laughs and is arguably overlong however it's enjoyable enough to not be bothered by those elements. The Intern is a very typical fish out of water story, and it is totally something that you can and probably should take your parents to. \"The Intern is light, and surprisingly, it's not all that different from 2013's The Internship. Good drama and cute story\" Intern gets there. With The Intern, meters has made another bright, contemporary america comedy with a lot on its mind - and works hard to make it look effortless. The Intern entertainingly fills that slot VERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] The Intern is directed and written by Nancy Meyers, and it stars Deniro and Hathawaye Hathaway in a comedy film about Ben whittler (Deniro) who's a senior and wants to apply for a job. With an 80% audience score, which is excellent, it'd say The Intern is definitely worth a rent. \"The Intern\" is a surefire hit for adults of all ages. \"The Intern\" is a movie made for a mature audience, and while the film has many laughs, the films undertone meanings are what really win your heart. The Intern exudes charm at every turn and drags you in from the first few scenes. As an intern in a senior program this cutesy movie is a good sundae afternoon diversion.

The film has many good messages, but is written with so much cheese and fluff that it would have fit better on The Hallmark ChHathawayel than as a major studio picture. Movie The Intern (I) (2015) was written and directed by Nancy Meyers. The Intern has a so-so IMDB rating of 7.1. It's not a rom-com and it doesn't have melisma McCarthy in the lead role, could The Intern be a positive change for modern cinematic comedy? Romantic Movie but Cute Still It shows another side of the Intern. It's also very different from the \"The Internship\" starring own Wilson and since Vaughan, which also dealt with the generation gap in a similar environment. The Intern should leave you smiling and hopeful. \"The Intern\" is evidence that movies can comedies can be uplifting, entertaining and sophisticated without crude humor and corny moments. The romance between intern Ben and company masseuse find and the sexual attraction they feel for each other is missing depth, edginess and perhaps some heartfelt comedic realness. \"The Intern\" is an instant day- maker and a true heart-warmer that urges you to be happy with life, act nice to people and become a better person for at least a couple of hours.

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_12: Robert De Niro has now found home in these comedies in which he can express a more amusing side of himself. One of the best comedy-drama films I have ever seen. The dialogue is hilarious. This movie is basically Devil Wears Prada-lite, except the jokes aren't as good. It doesn't really get as much comedy as it should out of its strange premise. It does occasionally begin to tire and start to get weird, but, thanks to the decent cast and their chemistry, it manages to stay afloat. Funny, interesting and overall very entertaining. awesome, best comedy have seen in a long time. Hilarious and not too heavy. There is substantial humor for the most part of the film until *semi-spoiler* it takes a more serious tone. It's funny enough, sweet, and charming. It was hilarious in places, touching in others. Many of the jokes are better if you some life experience. A movie for all ages...even the kids in the theater were laughing. It's a funny, charming and breezy. I belly laughed often. The film perfectly balances the comedic moments & the dramatic moments, & is a flawless fusion of comedy & drama. When the movie is funny, it's laugh-out-loud funny. Good job Nancy Meyers for creating another enjoyable delightful (not silly), grown up comedy with likable characters. It's not a hilarious movie, but there are plenty of laughs and smiles throughout. A good fit for date-night or just for some subtly family humor to get through the weekend. The only sequence that even attempted comedy was painfully cliché.

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_14: Including the hope for redemption at the end. All the pieces seem to be there except a truly appropriate third act. The story was pretty standard stuff however fun to watch and something to take away. Well worth a watch; although I wished a couple of the endings went a different way. The story is beyond predictable, it's actually a little meh. The leads have terrific chemistry, but the overly treacly ending is an eyesore. After the movie was finished both my husband and I said we didn't want it to end and wanted to know what happened after. The film begins well but sinks heavily into melodrama with a predictable ending. It has a few funny moments and some great performance from its leads and its supporting cast. It drags along and doesn't have a satisfying enough ending. movie get's 4.5 because the ending was a bit abrupt and although a lot of things wrapped up it just would've been nice to see a nice epilogue rather than just end-blackout. The writing by Nancy Meyers is pretty interesting in a way that ism invested in the characters who are developed enough for me to find them likable and memorable. The writing was very nearly flawless except for the husband character who needed some work. The plot was good, the drama a bit over the top, and the ending is a big? The ending is so abrupt and story lines are left in limbo and never wrapped up. The script is generally well developed and the final result is a crowd-pleaser. The story may lack depth and be unsurprising with some dramatic short cuts in the second half but mostly engages and is charmingly frothy and lively. The ludicrous plot plays out better than you'd expect, it turns into something beautiful and heartfelt. A promising start leads to a contrived story and muddled finale. The writing was awful and the dialog was idiotic. The chemistry between the main characters is great, it is well acted and the story became even more moving. It really does have a real warmth with unusually characters that are all likeable and get even more so. So poorly written it made me wHathawaya leave the theater multiple times. The writing was terrible and seemed like events were thrown in at random, fluidity never considered. The entire caper scene followed by the drinking scene when she should have gone home to the husband and child belonged on the cutting room floor. The movie is well-paced, decently developed characters yet does have a few weak plot moments. The story line of the relationship between the two main characters is well done however I would rather have seen a possible takeover rather than the marriage falling apart. The ending came mercifully too late, and if that was an ending, the viewer has no idea. The story is kind of plain, so the audience can predict most of the events that come about throughout the journey of both characters. Main characters in a not too cliché way (sorry don't want to spoil too much). Based on the three-act-structure, it has a funny energetic beginning, heartwarming middle, and a somewhat dramatic ending. and woefully underused. The housebreak scene superfluous and unnecessary, and the ending weak. The relationship between the two main characters has such depth that you can forgive the lack of understanding in the other areas, and its beautiful to see it blossom from the start. The atmosphere of this movie wasn't that exiting nor breathtaking but the dramatic sides of it covered everything. The only thing I did not like it was the end. The story is not bad. I thought before u started watching it i knew what i was going to get, but it gave a couple of surprising twists in the story line. kinda lapin's character, for example, was extraneous.\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_15: The performances won't get recognized at the award level, but I haven't enjoyed desire this much in a long time. It was nice see them share the screen with a legend such as De Niro. The production quality was great. Will definitely be watching it again. This is way overrated. Much better than I was expecting, funny stuff and definitely reccommended. Predictable, but, satisfying entertainment. Slow paced so I would suggest this for a chill lay in the bed and eat ice cream type of movie. This was really enjoyable. It reminded me of a much better version of 'Devil Wears Prada' in a way. It's a bit too heavy on the sentimental side, and it has some problems with pacing. Overall worth seeing, but don't raise your expectations. The sprightly, feelgood and very easy to warm to tone of the first half is replaced in the second half by pacing that tends to sag and things taking too much of a melodramatic and schmaltzy tone. The only reason I ended up watching it was because I was cooking in the Caribbean and needed a time out in a beautifully air conditioned room. I loved how they mix between the classic culture with the modern one. Liked this more than I expected to. It is paced very nicely, and has some very subtly sweet moments indeed. A must watch for a dozen good reasons. No need to see this in a theater as it will play well on a home platform. The way of clothing is simply smart and at last this is movie if are bored with thiller, ski first et and don't know what to watch. I was stunned reading other peoples bad reviews. You will love it.

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_16: The script, the acting of the two leads, the story and how much you feel for the relationships, all very well done. Sadly, the other actors are not up to caliber, with a mincingly badly directed and badly acted scene at the climax of the film. The supporting cast were all weak cardboard cutouts of young people stereotypes. The cast is topnotch and the story is more than just the light fluff expected from these comedies. The casual racism of nearly-all-white casting is just one of many bizarre disconnects between reality and Hollywood. The actors fell into their roles in cadence and it transported me from the beginning to the end, with ease. The cast did an awesome job of making you believe what they were doing was real. Good cast but a bit slow in places, a good but predictable storyline. I love it when great actors make silly movies about love, family and dates strictly for the paycheck. Entertaining, funny & great casting! I liked how the costumes of the characters all clearly were different from each other and were used to identify who the character was. The supporting cast is funny, but they are not the principal players. Trite, unreformed storyline with one-dimensional characters. \"The Leads, are simply brilliant! Robert Leighton's Editing is pretty good\" \"The chemistry between all the actors was impeccable!\" \"The supporting cast is fantastic as well, each well balanced into the grand story to play their parts\" Hathawayy collinsia lifetimes acting experience served up with pure raw emotion. Great acting throughout but especially desires body and face movements made a positive suprise. A warm, and good story about the challenges of success. The cast is doing a terrific job and the main characters have good chemistry. The interactions between the characters are genuine and touching, leaving a lasting impact on the audience. I was most disappointed in the lack of diversity in the cast, even the extras. The supporting cast - rent Russo (the office masseuse), Andrew RHathawayells, madam DeVine, each Pearlman, Jason Orley, Christina Scherer, Nat Wolff, celiac teston et al - is to the person terrific.

Deniro & Hathaway is undeniable and makes you wHathawaya be friends with them. love the acting of Deniro and Hathawaya hatchway they just worked together wonderfully. Deniro/Hathaways are a really good pair. Denito and Hathaways are phenomenal in this feel good movie. Hathaway and Deniro compliment each other perfectly Deniro is charming as the old guy sharing his wisdom with a beautiful Hathaway. The relationship between Deniro and Hathaway was spot on and I recommend it if you want laughter and drama. performances! Deniro and Hathaway play very well together!! Hathawaya and Deniro were magical together. Robert Deniro and Hathaway have excellent work chemistry. The idea of mixing a pompously acting Deniro with a hysterically acting Hathaway is an example of how not to generate onscreen chemistry. Some of the scenes really touch your heart, especially the conversations between Hathaway and Deniro. Hathawaye Hathaway did her usual catch for a character and played well enough. Both Deniro and Hathaway give good performances, and their chemistry feels natural throughout the films a little too long length. I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies starring Robert Deniro. Hathaway and Deniro are perfect for their roles and have a great chemistry that is so effective, it brings the whole movie together. Deniro proves (again) that he is a really good all round actor (not just a tough guy actor), and Hathaway is also excellent. Deniro. and Hathaway give a great performance to this movie because of their great acting skills and connection towards their characters friendship.

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_18: Hathaway character is out is control, clearly not able to handle a growing company, completely oblivious of teach (like not using email recall), and sinking it even more out of her power trip of not having a boss. desire and Hathaway have good chemistry here, but the overall emotional tone is too mushy for me; feels manipulative. Hathaway makes an awesome character, power woman and making a reference to working moms which is a social issue today. Hathaway plays the high pressure successful alpha female role quite well but doesn't soar to any great heights as her character's interactions are just a little shallow. Terrific acting from Robert De Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway can't salvage the film from its cliched feel good routes nor from the boring girlish Devil Wears Prada routes. Hathaway is very convincing and most ambitious working moms will be able to relate to her character. Some things just don't make sense, like why is Hathawaya Hathaway character a millionaire but the husband has to be stay at home dad? The chemistry between Robert de Niro and Hathawaye Hathaway is pure magic on screen. Promising premise isn't fulfilled by a rather pedestrian plot, but the chemistry of Hathaway and i hero are worth the ticket. Hathawaye Hathaway smoulders all the way through this and if she isn't the Audrey Hepburn for the 2000's, then nobody will be. The film suffers mildly from having no villain or major conflict, but makes up for it with the charming interplay between desire and Hathaway. Robert, and Renee. desire has rarely been more pleasant to watch, or Hathaway so winning, as they lead an ensemble cast that complements each other wonderfully. The little girl who played Hathaway daughter was a joy to watch. A nice little movie with a great chemistry between Hathaway and De Niro. Hathawaye Hathaway, as the genius behind a too-fast growing company is playing what I consider one of her best roles yet. I was impressed, also, by wanders Holm who played Hathaway husband. Hathaway character isn't far from her \"Devil Wears Prada\" spin. Hathaway delivers a captivating performance as Jules Ostin, the young and driven CEO. Hathawaya Hathaway character reminded me of a little too much of The Devil wears Prada. The acting by both desire and Hathaway is super and one of the biggest reasons this movie is so fun to watch. Hathaway gives a solid performance as a hard-working, always busy and on the phone type person with focused drive. Incredible performance from Bob Deniro which could have been written for him in mind. Hathawaye Hathaway completely runs the whole show. Hathaway shines as Jules, portraying a complex and dynamic character, balancing vulnerability with strength and determination. The weaknesses of the movie are the saccharine sweet family scenes between Hathawaye Hathaway character, her husband and daughter. The only reason this doesn't get a 1 star is down to De Niro and Hathaway. The first hour was great and I started to care about the characters...but by the time I walked out of the cinema, there was a mild Hathawayoyance of even bothering to care... Hathawaye Hathaway emanates simplicity and elegance, playing her role as the overworked, ambitious wife. Robert De Niro joins a widower as an intern at an e-commerce site. He meets Hathawaye Hathaway, the female boss of the company. The film touches on some of the subjects foiling industry today. Hathawaye Hathaway always be the perfect-suit to play this kind of role, as she did in Devils Wears Prada. Hathaway has a fabulous on screen persona which works well with De Niro. I think his part was both written as two-dimensional and acted flatly, especially in contrast to the effusive and expressive Hathawaya Hathaway.\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_19: Nancy Meyers really excels at these rom-com movies that make you feel like the characters are believable and the storyline might actually be believable. The idea that a woman could run her own company was undermined by her having to be taught the values of bygone days by an older man. Robert De Niro plays a widower who becomes indispensable to a harried woman trying to run her own company. The Way is typically riveting, switching between the light and heavy with her usual skill. Hollywoodiennes, mais sauvee par le couple De Niro Hathaway and par l'approche sociologique americaine plutot fine de Nancy Meyers. The smooth progression of their relationship is delightfully affecting, ultimately submitting a platonic father-daughter eminence. Nancy Myers' amusing and purposeful script and direction highlight the virtues of women making the most of their lives, but never hits us over the head with her message. Even a career woman needs love, no matter what the cost, you always remind us. Nancy Meyers gets a bad rap as the rom-com has become a passe genre. The big twist (not that surprising) does not really raise the drama although Nancy is trying to say somethings. Writer/Director Nancy Meyers Geezer-Gal is so Hip.

The film explores the value of experience, the need for work-life balance, and the struggles faced by women in positions of power. Writer/Director Nancy Meyers brings an assured touch for what is really an old fashioned story with a modern twist. Bob Deniro stars as a successful entrepreneur female with a husband who has an affair and is rattled by her busy life. He becomes involved with her life after he basically becomes her chauffeur and discovers the indiscretion of her stay-at-home husband to their young daughter. The film is written and directed by Nancy Meyers, who also directed It's Complicated, The Holiday, Something's Gotta Give and What Women Want. The story has plenty to say about inter-generational relations and about feminism. The film poses a few questions about man versus woman in the workplace, adultery and relevance. The outstanding performance of the newcomer, little Paige, shows us we will be seeing much more of her. The movie moved us in uniquely 2015-era ways: old-school businessman endorses young working woman's career. Nancy Meyers is a very good director. She knows how to make a sentimental movie with a great story. The writing really addresses the juggling act that just century professional women attempt daily. The female protagonist chose to forgive & stay w her husband who cheated on her. She addresses issues such as sexism feminism and a working woman's quandary over pursuing your dreams or compromising them for your family. The movie is about the trials of the working professional mother and how wisdom through life experience can be used to improve her life. The issue which tells us about feminism were packed in a good way.\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_2: Robert Deniro stars as Ben Whittaker coming out of retirement and eventually being accepted as an intern for internet selling sensation Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway) One day, he notices her driver is a bit too drunk to drive and he takes his place as Jules driver. Ben starts out as a useless minion to Jules, but over time he evolves into a trusted sidekick. By the end of the film, Ben is arguably Jules equal, and also her mentor. Most of the conflict comes from Jules' marriage, and that just shouldn't be the central premise of a film in this day and age, especially when it's tacked on at the end. The chemistry between he (Ben) and Hathawaye Hathaway \"Jules\" was dynamic and most enjoyable. Fun, but seems misplaced, and the resolutions to some of the story's conflicts seem a little trite, but, overall, this is simply a delightful film that it'd recommend to anyone. Jules is a representation of the new age entrepreneurial business kicksorters who are admired today. The film easily shows that every challenge she is going through will easily be handled. Hathawaye Hathaway is a Type A driven and obsessed with details company leader. Jules also has a husband, a young daughter and a fabulous brownstone. The final thirty minutes are taken up with her tears, Ben being the understanding grandfatherly advice type. The movie was flawless, feel good time, inspiring and motivational for start up, youngster and old. The subplot of Jules (Hathaway) trying to find balance at home...by the looks of it, her husband didn't HAVE TO be a stay-at-home dad. Hathawaye Hathaway plays Jules, the entrepreneur/working mom, who is way in over her head with her job. Despite the lack of action, deep drama and pressing moments, apart from the hilarious scene where Ben and some boys try to break into Jules' mother's home, the film was lovely, easy to watch and uplifting. Company's led by Jules often (Hathawaye Hathaway) who's so busy that she's persuaded to scour for a new CEO. Meanwhile, Ben, being an intern to Jules, doesn't have a lot to do, but soon finds himself becoming a mentor and a friend of sorts. The bond that develops between Jules and Ben is quite heartwarming and even though much of it is predictable and elements of the story are a tad contrived it's a film that's very hard not to like. Jules is played in a winning performance by Hathaway – the sort that Meg ran used to revel in. The relationship that develops between Ben and Jules (Hathaway) is beautifully done. The movie is about how he gets close to Jules and helps her both professionally and personally. I loved how Jules marriage turned out not to be the perfect one that we first thought (even tho in the end it goes back to perfect) Hathawaye Hathaway plays Jules Ostin, a twenty-something CEO of a rising online fashion startup. Ben (Robert De Niro) helps Jules not only with the company but also with her personal life. The story of Jules shows that happiness doesn't come from aligning with others, making sacrifices and hiding things from too observant people. The protagonists, Jules and Ben, are very strong characters and are played beautifully by Hathawaya and Deniro. Jules is used to portray the modern woman who breaks the social norms of the stay-at-home mother to pursue her dreams.\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_3: Robert De Niro plays a many Poppins/Jeeves type character who never puts a foot wrong. His unbelievable, sage, kindly older man character is fairly 2 dimensional. His is the only decent performance, trying to extract pathos and subtlety where there is none. Robert de Niro plays a very sweet grandpa-ish character. His character is much different than the one we're used to. Mr. De Niro, I have never seen him so precious in a film. Daniel Holm feels a bit miscast as the husband. Robert De Niro plays a 70-year-old middle-class man who has spent his career as VP of a publishing company. The rest of the characaters are not really explored serving variously as foils for de Niro or Hathaway. Theodore Shapiro delivers a whimsical and delightful soundtrack for whatever the tone of the scene requires. Bobby_x0085_ who has never done a bad thing in his life. Bobby drops by to give \"Matt\" (Anders Holm) a piece of his righteous mind, Matt has to tell him to \"watch out for all the legs pieces\" everywhere. The whole movie revolves around Bobby's life and how he cheers up everybody around him all the time with his cuteness and wisdom. \"He's such a charismatic and likable character. He's super competent, humble, kind, caring, and hard-working\" \"He delivers the business savvy and vulnerability that make this role convincing and entertaining\" Ben Whittacker plays a heartwarming old man trying to be relevant again. Robert De Niro is... (well, what can you say?) If not the best, one of the best acts of his life. \"He mesmerizes you throughout the movie. You feel for his character and the position he's in. His advice that comes from his experience is so valuable for June and coworker\" \"There is no one that can top that man\" Robert De Niro is an epitome of being a gentleman- one who says the right things at the right times. There is unarguably no one in this whole world who could have done better justice to this role as he has.\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_4: Hathawayot shows that women can be on top but it is done in the most disgraceful way. The messages about social and gender roles seem overly simplified and sort of muddy at the same time. Life lessons are demonstrated naturally and not in a boring way. The film has the potential to challenge the incessant questions kick-butt actresses and female coos are asked about balancing home and work. While it says some right things about the commerce startup industry, it is too muddled and superficial in depicting it on screen. The rom-com tone is a bit out of place at times. It could be its natural and clever dialogue. It could be highlighting the importance of classical \"manhood\". Because women be shoppin' I had one obsessive, recurring thought running through my mind, and I think it made me bristle more at every pleasantly retarded little moment. When did men stop being men and remain little boys? \"It's pure fluff and its pretty much everything you would probably expect it to be. The relationships are fantastic and not forced. It doesn't feel contrived like so many others like it. There isn't a thing wrong with it. Some good points were made along the way\" It's also an extravaganza of product placement galore mainly for Apple Computer, fancy linens and jazzed-up bathtubs, escalades, a little token tai-chi thrown in, as you feast on the row houses and brownstones of Park Slope. It's rare to see a more nuanced relationship. The music score is nothing that sticks in the mind. \"It is not condescending Stereotypical Crapula nonsense. Everyone at the firm is a millennial who has no knowledge of anything human including the owner\" \"The whole thing is celebrating unsustainable business (all clothes of the company made in Bangladesh for sure) fused by shallow Hipster-Mutants\" \"It toys with a lot of liberal, socially relevant issues without presenting any concrete ideas in a convincing mHathawayer\" \"It's just a two hour long placebo that you would watch if you were part of a control group in a lab\" \"I like the messages, but there's a way to get them across better without beating the audience over the head and dumping down the material\" meter is a unique, different story about friendship, family, success, pain and forgiveness. The script doesn't have a lot going on but at the same time it never pretends it does. meters also handles the inevitable romantic tension between the stars quite well. Hathawayoying. desire most definitely is NOT phoning this one in - he gives it a very good effort (maybe not A+, but...) and it shows. It's like pulling on an old, comfortable sweater or a really well worn-in pair of shoes. A lot of product placement too (Starbucks, Skype, etc) became distracting. The movie shows the issues that running a status entails, a lot of work, crazy hours, little sleep, poor diet, and most importantly the endangering of personal relationships. It also deals with the confusion of gender roles that couples face. Despite this however, cheating must not be justified. The central focus of Act 2? Turns out the boss's home life is far from perfect. The roles of beck and cameroon are given more depth, yet, still one dimensional, really. The script just doesn't go that deep. Being a high roller is a tough job, be a man or a woman. It's not all it's cracked up to be. Fulfillment originate from ours inner drivers - not the expertise level.\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_5: So warm, so satisfying and so moved! Just a classic, pulls at all the good heartstrings, the best duo! I bit long but good story So fresh, warm, cozy and positive. it makes me feel warm and cozy in my chest, a very nostalgic feeling Simple but sweet! Pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. The story is good the music is beautiful. And you wind up with a pleased smile. Cute, if implausible. Like cotton candy, sweet, but nothing really there. Heartfelt and inspiring. Great role for desire Funny, clever, with a great message. Extremely sappy, but also extremely entertaining and heartfelt. Brought a smile to my face. Pleasantly touching. Wonderful perspective on the world today. desire is so sweet and charming, a great subdued performance from an anytime great. The tone can be summed up in one word: cute. The chemistry between these two was electric and the on-the-bed scene was done with loving taste with no hint of anything but friendship. The major message is taking a breath, relaxing, take time to retire from the hectic world and just take a minute to appreciate your surroundings. if you are not in your best of spirits as I was quite ill while i saw this. It does contain some quite well-delivered sympathetic moments as well. The touches of emotion under pressure were presented well. I love everything about it. Wonderful! Terrific! Superb masterpiece, digging right into your soul and heart.\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_6: A retired 70-year-old widower, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), is bored with retired life. Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn't intend to give him work and it is just window dressing. The movie s ending is ambiguous -- does Ben no longer need to mentor? Ben (De Niro) is a retired widower looking to fill in an empty part of his life. Eventually Ben becomes more than just the intern as the two form a friendship. Ben is at the story's center, but it's the great mix of interesting characters and subplots that makes this movie so worthwhile. Robert De Niro stars as Ben Whittaker, a retired 70 year old widower, who just can't seem to find meaning in hobbies and the leisure life. The film was hilarious, touching though never unconvincing and certainly moving with the example Ben leads. Robert De Niro brings a charming blend of wisdom, humor, and vulnerability to the character, making Ben an endearing and relatable presence. The generation gap, sociological commentary, and great narrative structure all in one film. Successful, sweetly observed comedy from Nancy Meyers. The film is about a seventy-year-old widower, Ben Whittaker, who learns that post-retirement life is easy but hellishly boring. Robert Deniro is Ben, in his early 70s, retired and recently a widower. Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom. Ben Whittaker, played by Robert De Niro, is a 70 year old widower who is trying to get back into the present world. A subtle blend of the old with the new..., old school Ben (De Niro) comes into an informal modern and overly trendy e-commerce business. Ben Whittaker (Robert Di Niro) a 70-year-old widower, applies for a senior internship in an exuberant online fashion retail company held by a very assiduous micro-manger Jules (Hathawaye Hathaway) The two of them get encountered as Ben becomes julep's personal intern. Ben becomes her right hand who is responsible for each aspect of her life. Robert De Niro plays Ben Whittaker, a seventy-year-old man who is struggling to find meaning in his life. Hathawaye Hathaway plays Jules Ostin, the founder of the company.\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_7: I can't believe what other critics are rating and saying about this movie. A gentle film with low stakes and surface level lessons/values. For the most part, this movie delivered. This is a terrible movie with an awful message. The film was able to capture the new Brooklyn landscape without letting the Hipsterfication of neighborhoods like Park Slope get in the way of telling this odd-couple story. There are lots of meaningful moments and the movie is entertaining. Where this film falters, is the choices made by some of the characters in the final act. The film does have a lot of its moments and some fast pacing, but every time the film focuses on dresses and cosmetics, it hits rock bottom. The \"sexual inneudo\" is not necessary and did not add to the movie! Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and ism not surprised that it made such a profit. The movie is a perfect blend of \"old school\" thinking before the internet and new school creativity. This could have been a generic ordinary film, but all of the performances and direction make this worth seeing. The film shows the environment of the corporate world and the coexistence of people from different generations. This is what i would call a perfect movie, it was not over done and it did not use any clinches i could see. There are a few scenes in the movie that could be cut to make it a little faster paced. In the end, it's a Nancy Meyers film... she has a certain style and it's probably not going to change. The Intern pourrait être un film dune bruise hallucinante avec ses personages unidimensionnels (De Niro est gentil, Hathaway est stressée...) mais le scenario do film refuse tellement tout forme de cynisme quail est impossible. Tres bon film a regarder avec tendre moitÃ©e! I had zero problems with this movie. This is not the typical movie in which I would elect to see normally. The actors engage you to pull you into the movie. The plot is thin, but the movie is charming. This movie proves that you don't need things blowing up all the time or people hopping in and out of bed to make a likeable movie. This is a film meant for simple viewing without any deeper meaning. This is probably the third best Nancy dyers movie have seen (Behind \"It's Complicated\" and \"Something's Gotta Give\"). At the end of the film a portion of the audience clamped with approval. The lack of people of color in this movie is only half the problem. If this movie makes any statements, the key takeaway is that being pathetic gets you ahead in life. This is not my typical kind of film. Laughed out loud more than once - all the good scenes are NOT in the movie trailers. A chick flick told only the way meters can. A nice change of pace from much of what Hollywood gives us. This movie manages to take several important social themes and reduce them to pulp, and even worse, reduce the principal characters to clichés. This movie reaffirms the old movie maxim - never judge a movie by its coming attractions. The theater was close to being packed with men, woman and children. The entire theater ended up cracking up numerous times. This movie should be categorized as a fantasy because there's barely a drop of real life in it. Not even the greatness of Robert de Niro can boost this movie to more than a 4/10. This is one of my most boring and horrible experiences in cinema. The first hour of the movie is sort of interesting and cute, but the remainder of the film is pretty mediocre, with the last half hour being talky, excruciatingly boring, and predictable. By the end I felt like I had sat through one of those awful mandatory he training films. The worst thing about this film though is that it challenges the idea (we all apparently have) that old people are stupid, useless liabilities. This movie works because its simple without the flashy n shallow stuff we see these days. I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. If you are all about getting money taken out of your pocket for the sake of it, this is your movie. This movie does not have an Identity. There are two relationships in the movie that didn't work for me at all. The company has a icehouse masseuse in rent runs as find and these scenes were uncomfortable to watch to say the least. DVD, a Netflix rental, so no extras, just the movie. I think Hollywood needs to take a lesson from this film and realise that not all stories have to be about people in their 20's. The most interesting scenes were the business, as opposed to the romantic, affairs. The writing makes it easy for you, but then there is a goofy screenplay that makes it difficult for repeat viewing. Despite being somewhat routine, and clichéd, the movie works. \"The meaning of life is your career and your social ascension\" - not my kind of film. A clever, beautifully made film that does not lose you for a moment. A weaker third act and an even weaker ending hurts an otherwise good film. Happy music doesn't make the film happy and the dialogs were terrible. on his first day, the movie seems to be heading in that direction, then he inexplicably plays hookie for the day, and... nothing other than \"just breathe\". These issues are handled with sensitivity and serve to enhance the narrative, making the film more relatable and thought-provoking. Surely they are not still making films like this. If you are not amused by such ageist insights, much of the movie will be lost on you. The movie doesn't promise too much, it doesn't expect to be this movie that will blow you away with hilarious laughter, serious scenes, or some other thing. While some may find the plot predictable, the movie's execution and performances more than compensate for it. While the cinematography is great, the film looks expensive and all; there is nothing of substance here. The movie is a feelgood idealistic scenario. The music used is upbeat and fits the accompanying scenes, however it isn't really anything special. There are few takeaways in the film. The movie ends with a positive note. This movie's cast and writing team alone easily could have earned this a 9/10. Good script, though I do feel that the film tries to do more than it has time for. Audience from all genres won't like the movie and if you have nothing to do this weekend then it's a good option to go for. This is a political correctness film, very well disguised by tenderness and pseudo-drama. Typical of Hollywood modern films undermining the traditional roles of sexes in the western world. The only plus of the film was De Niro. The movie is a breath of fresh air to Deniro filmography. There is no noisy or irritating action, sex, violence or cog which you will see in most of the movies released in the past decade. The references to bipolar disorder in this movie, equating this devastating and potentially fatal illness, to a 4 year old's temper tantrum is at the height of insensitivity and cruelty. harsh and unappealing to working moms who view this film and I believe that Meyers, a working mother herself, could have done a better job avoiding this. So many different aspects of this movie stand out to me as a strength. Not just the name but the whole idea and process of the movie.\n",

      "review_cluster_review_cluster_8: Robert Deniro gives one of the best performances in the last few years. A better movie for Deniro then some of his recent stuff. The elephant in the room is Ben, played superbly by Deniro with just the right mix of understated sensitivity. Deniro is great as always. Just as conventional as you'd expect Deniro doing movies of this sort these days. The understated Deniro is best. Is always good to see Deniro D Niro. Robert Deniro is unrecognizable in this performance which is actually quite impressive. The only thing that amused me here is Deniro acting Deniro was great. And Deniro DiNero was just a boring character with no real flaws. Loved it and Deniro aced it again. Robert Deniro plays the title character, a retired 70 year-old widower who has become bored with his life. Since committing to comedy nearly full time (Analyze This, Meet the Parents), Deniro has gotten the audience to warm to him more as an Everyman. in his comfort zone in this pleasant comedy from Nancy Meyers. The irresistible charm and a script filled with pleasantly amusing lines and small scenes. A welcome change of pace as of late for acting titan Deniro. retired man who joins the working world when he turns 70. But don't worry, Deniro comes and saves the day, and the best compliment we can give it is that it doesn't appear manipulative or far fetched. I love it that you can read every emotion from Deniro's facial gestures, and his character in the movie. Robert Deniro is on form here, not his heyday form, but if you consider some of the material he's done just of late, it's pretty decent. Deniro appears to be making a pretty good comedy career in films now. The film leans more towards a family film rather than a comedy. Deniro delivers a standout performance as Ben, capturing the essence of a man who is both wise and vulnerable. The film is cute and has heart, much of this is due to the performance from Deniro. Deniro diner is great but the character's quirks are tiring after about 10 minutes. The Intern is one of the sweetest movies made lately Deniro is the reason which made this movie so like-able. Robert Deniro was pretty good but we were rooting for him to die or get the job. An \"oldie but goodie\" persona (talke Last vegan and Dirty Grandpa for instance) but he is not the same in each role despite the character his age has him play. Deniro desirous character was thoughtful and competent.\n",
